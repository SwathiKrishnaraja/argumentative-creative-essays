5f19559b9665f700090276c4,"Climate change is a globally relevant issue that has the potential to affect people in every corner of the world. In this essay, I'll propose 5 unique and actionable methods of fighting global warming and the resulting climate change that support social, economic and environmental sustainability:
1. Public transportation initiatives and tax concessions. By encouraging more people to use public transportation and bicycles, we can effectively keep more vehicles off the roads, lower CO2 emissions on a wide scale, and use tax concessions to incentivize more people to leave their vehicles at home.
2. Compostable packaging. Biodegradable packaging can have similar impacts and degradation time scales as plastic packaging. By using more compostable packaging, we can ensure that our packaging is truly eco-friendly and that our packaging materials align with our claims of sustainability.
3. Low carbon diet promotion. Diet can play a huge role in personal carbon footprint reduction. Initiatives that promote vegan and vegetarian options, locally sourced produce, and meat-free meals can have a significant impact, especially when people choose these options together, like 'Meat Free Mondays'.
4. Tree planting. Deforestation is a huge driver of climate change. Tree planting initiatives that focus on biodiversity, rewilding, and planting species native to the area can help to ensure that our forests and woodlands are available for generations to come.
5. Petition local governments. Governments and corporations hold the bulk of power in this world, and can enact far-reaching policies to reduce carbon emissions and promote more planet friendly methods of travel, dining, manufacturing, shipping and business operation.

611e1f608f92b6c9b825bcca,"My ideas to fight climate change include the following : 

-Changing our eating habits by avoiding meat and dairy products, this is one of the biggest ways to reduce our environmental impact on the planet. We should try to choose fresh, seasonal produce that is grown locally to help reduce the carbon emissions from transportation, preservation and prolonged refrigeration.

- Avoiding flying as our main mode of transportation. Flying produces a lot of carbon emissions which are very harmful to the environment. Take a step back and think if you really need to fly out of town for that meeting rather than having it online. Maybe you can rethink that international trip you have and keep it local instead 

- Limit the usage of your motor vehicle. Instead of getting in the car, walk or cycle and enjoy the physical and mental health benefits, and the money saved. For longer journeys, use public transport, or try car sharing schemes.In this case , you are saving the world and saving your money as well. 

-Protect green spaces. Green spaces, such as parks and gardens, are important. They absorb carbon dioxide and are associated with lower levels of air pollution.They help to regulate temperature by cooling overheated urban areas, can reduce flood risk by absorbing surface rainwater and can provide important habitats for a wide variety of insects, animals, birds and amphibians.They also provide multiple benefits to public health, with studies linking green space to reduced levels of stress."

Food waste in the US occurs mostly in stores and at home—either because it spoils on the store shelf or before we can eat it.  We can combat food waste by shopping for what you need, eating leftovers, composting scraps, and donating excess to food banks. You 

2. Eat Plant-Based
Transitioning to a vegetarian diet can cut your carbon footprint in half, and going vegan, even lower. Even shifting from high to low meat consumption can shrink your footprint by a third,

3. Use Clean Energy  and Use LED Lighting
Renewable energy is fundamental to powering the world as we move away from fossil fuels. . Ask your representatives to support this bill to make Clean Energy Victory Bonds a reality. Additionally, you can purchase renewable energy from installers such as Blue Pacific Solar and RGS Energy, as well as plug into renewable utilities which don’t require you to install any new hardware in your home to get sun- and wind-power.

4. Participate in the Democratic Process
Climate change has implications on local, national, and global levels. While the average person isn’t responsible for governing a nation, we are responsible for deciding who does. Vote for a climate activist, support comprehensive climate policies, and use your citizen voice to contact legislators when you disagree. 

5. Improve Insulation
One of the most cost-effective and accessible tactics to combating the climate crisis is better insulation. Older homes can lose up to 35 percent of heat through their walls. Modern insulation reduces the energy needed to heat a home, therefore reducing emissions and saving you money. .

6. Rethink Transportation
Overhauling the world’s transportation systems, both commercial and personal, would save as much CO2 as one billion acres of regenerative agriculture.

7. Recycle
Acquiring virgin resources—from logging trees to mining minerals—exploits more resources than recycling existing materials. For example, recycled aluminum products use 95 percent less energy than creating new ones. About 50 percent of recycled materials come from households"
60e0d0e810dc0d3c0eb7ea90,"We have to start traveling in shared vehicles and using public transport, using green energies and switching to them. We have to plan our trips and combine them. Replace our vehicle with something similar to a bicycle, being natural and simply being with the earth. Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety, and jobs. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate shocks, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy like solar or wind will reduce the emissions that drive climate change. Adapting to climate impacts protects people, households, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure, and natural ecosystems. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the rise in temperature has not been and will not be uniform or smooth across the country or over time. The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest hurricanes (Category 4 and 5), have been noted since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. The intensity of storms associated with hurricanes and rainfall rates are expected to increase as the climate continues to warm. Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to the region's economy and environment. Extreme heat will affect health, energy, agriculture and more. The decrease in water availability will have economic and environmental impacts. Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all related to climate change, have increased wildfires. Diminishing water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat and flooding, and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns.

5f67738a1aadce071e716263,"Cut back on eating meat and diary, this is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. This can also be beneficial to your health, so it is a win-win. Try to limit consumption and waste to limit your carbon footprint. Respect and protect green areas such as parks and gardens as they absorb carbon dioxide and help lower air pollution. Plant trees and create your own green space with pot plants added around your house, Reduce your energy bills and consumption to cut your carbon footprint by doing simple tasks like switching of lights that are not being used and replacing lightbulbs with energy efficient bulbs. Leave your car at home to limit your carbon footprint and as a bonus you will improve your health as well. Also try and limit your flying. If you travel a lot for work, try video conferencing instead. It will not just help with you carbon footprint, but also help with your budget. Lastly I think we should all use our voices to help spread awareness of all the ways anybody can help, no matter how young or old you are. We can inspire people through simply setting a good example and being the change we want to see in the world. Simple changes can make a big difference in the grand scheme of things. These are my best ideas to help do our part in saving out planet and making it more green and more viable for future generations. "
616721ae6f6c6b77a7242f41,"We must not be indifferent to the future of all of us. What makes people's character is their consideration not only for other people but also for the environment. If we do not act now, we will live worse. Extreme weather fluctuations, the end of holidays, the end of joyful life as we know it now. You don't have to buy an electric car right away to help the world. Start by sorting your garbage, lowering the temperature in your house or apartment in the winter, conserve water. Think about the carbon footprint you are creating. You can help the planet in the kitchen, on holiday, in your car, in your home, with friends. Replacing a conventional halogen bulb costs virtually nothing and has a huge impact not only on the environment, but also on your wallet. Did you know that you can save up to $250 a year in your home? Urban transport? Oh yeah, it's cheaper, often faster and greener. The same amount of people that fits in 10 car can fit in just one vehicle. You can get help anywhere. Big change is not about big steps, but just the opposite. Small changes are the foundation for change. The basic idea is to cut back on activities that use whatever resources are on the planet. In the case of light bulbs, for example, it's all about light time. Try to keep this in mind, spread the tips to friends, family and acquaintances. Educate yourself. It's not just about the future, it's about the present. It's not just about yourself, it's about everyone, including your family, children, friends and our home, our planet. Act now."
60b6868793cf7b832392a38b,"Unfortunately, people only acknowledge questions such as the climate change when they are negatively impacted by these challenges. Therefore, some ideas that can reinforce change focus on the monetization of good measures - penalizing those that do not practice them and providing a monetary prize to those who do. 
Incentivising such behaviors can help improve the reduction of produced residues which will help the sustainability of the world. Furthermore, some more strict gas emissions policies are required to help reduce the impact on the stratosphere.
Several things can be performed to reduce emissions and residue production - the recovery for energy production, their treatment and usage for other steps within the process they are resulting from are feasible examples. 
Many processes can integrate reused emissions and products after treatment, not only providing the reduction of waste but also reducing the payments involved in the process.
Big companies have already established this type of system successfully, maybe it should become a common practice and be incentivised by monetized prizes.
Furthermore, these solutions are mostly relatively simple to integrate within many common processes, resulting in the diminished environmental footprint of the enterprises that establish them. 
On another hand, some sensibility campaigns can be prepared to further implement this sustainable mentality in young children, developing their interest and enabling them with tools to help improving the world. "
5ede17df5600b50241a7443d,"Climet change is an all around big issue that encapsulates many different but dangerous problems, but thankfully, because of that, we are able to apply many solutions to them.
To start off, we could put in place or even mandate pollution limits on each country as to limit how much enterprises polute our enviroment. This would help greatly because enterprises are the biggest contributors to contamination.
We could also build more green spaces and deemphasize going around cities on cars instead of public transport bringing many benefits appart from less polution, like a better public transport infraestructure and less air pollution all around.
On top of that there should be studies into how we could recycle radioactive materials, because just burying them underground could result in accidents later on.
Another way to help would be to create voluntary bodies where people can partake in cleaning their city, while at the same time teaching them how recicling is very important.
Lastly we should analize how everything is truly recicled, because a part of what we recicle ends up in dumpster sites on other countries where they are not truly recicled and only lay there corroding the land.
Those are by far not the only ways to  create a better enviroment for our descendants, but they are the ones I was able to think off that would be very beneficial and could be implemented without much difficulty in the most part. The most important part of this is comitting to the cause and not deeming it unnecesary when we are halfway through"
6114242b9bb244326ceb185f,"fighting climate change seems impossible if you are just a regular citizen, the real fight needs to come from the big rich companies, if companies like amazon, shein, and their similars, started genuenly caring about the enviorment the changes would be easier. Avoiding waste, being careful of carbon emissions, being mindful of plastic packaging, caring about reusable objects and avoiding things that are to be thrown away after just one usage. the list could potentially be infite, colonialism and capitalism has made it to be this way, short terms usage, waste, compulsively buying new things, needing more than we actually do, we have been shaped this way, the economic circle has shaped us this way, it has made almost impossibe to live a sustainable life if you dont have enough money or time. the wealthy and rich have opporunities while the working class struggles. money could help repair the some of the damage done by colonialism, redistribuiting money and goods and taxing the rich could potentially help those in need, while doing this, the sustainability could increase. the inaccessibility of sustainability is the rich's fault. we need changes that come from the upper class and the rich business need to start acually caring about the enviorment other than greenwash their social media pages, they also need to start paynig their workers a living wage and giving them better conditions, so that they can manage a more sustainable life. furthermore, plastic. a material that has been useful but badly managed, some is indispensable, some is useless and harmful, reducing the useless ones some changses could be made. much packaging could be avoided and replaced with more sustainable one, we need to be able to recycle most of it to avoid pollution. "
6038e63a1713653046ef7482,"Every country should switch to renewable energy sources. You have to force the governments of all countries to do this. Poorer countries must be helped to achieve this goal. Meat production and consumption should be restricted. More forests and trees should be planted. Concrete in cities needs to be reduced. Do not mow the grass in cities and plant as many flower meadows as possible. This will help maintain a lower temperature in large cities.  People should start taking care of the environment themselves, stop buying plastic bottles. People should buy less clothing, those they do not use to sell or give to those who will find them useful.children from an early age should learn how to take care of the environment. Aware of the risks, the child becomes a responsible adult. The most important thing is the fight against the widespread concreteization of cities. Maintaining an adequate level of rivers and lakes. Not to dry out natural water bodies. It is necessary to reforest as many areas as possible that lie fallow. The most important thing is that the earth should be as green as possible. Then the climate will not warm up so quickly and there will not be so many natural disasters. I have no more ideas on how to help protect the environment. Everything remains in the hands of the people. They are the ones who have to start taking care of our plate. People have to look for ways to volunteer for the land themselves. This can be limiting garbage, limiting water consumption, planting flowers that wasps like the most, or planting trees"
6137aaf89c3f9544d0232079,"Fighting climate change requires everyone to take part and it starts small. The fight against climate change should begin at preventing more damage from happening. Eliminating all threats is a basis for fighting climate change, the planting of trees is fundamental in the fight of climate change, the greener the environment the more chance we have to fight climate change. Change of technology needs to be implemented, moving away from technology which burns and produce unhealthy toxins to the air to technology which will produce healthy toxins for example cars that use renewwble energy, solar. It is important to use tools that will not have negative impact in the later years, for example the use of solar energy is very important as it has no negative impact on the fight against climate change. Also the oceans play a vital role in climate change hence we need to take care of it and keep it clean and safe. The should also be amount of money paid to ensure that overuse and over production of toxins that are released in the air can be replaced and use the money to help eliminate all toxins also this will prevent people from producing those harmful toxins. Technology is a key factor in fighting climate change and essential that we use it in a way that it wont affect our fprodu. The overcrowding in cities should be eliminated as this is one of high factor causing climate change  cause there are too many productions in a city and too much cars producing carbon dioxide with little of trees"
6108033c1bf591fee2013a07,"Climate change is a real problem that needs to be addressed. We have only one planet to live on. With the help of these ideas, it will be possible for us to fight climate change and make our world a better place.

Plan and combine trips: Try to travel by car only when necessary and take public transportation for the rest of your trips. You can possibly significantly reduce your carbon emissions using these two methods of travel.

Drive more efficiently: Keep your car in good condition, keep your tires inflated and follow the speed limit. Accelerating too much uses more fuel and increases your carbon emissions.

Reduce your power use: Turn off the lights, TVs, computers and other electronic devices when not in use. Plus, you can open your windows for fresh, clean air instead of using an air-conditioner. 

Use green power where possible (or invest in it): If you have access to renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines - use them! A simple way to do this is to install solar panels to your roof to power your home and get off the grid. In addition to solar panels, work with your neighbours and community to erect wind turbines to power your area.

Send emails and letters to your local representatives: Let them know how strongly you feel about climate change and how it affects our lives. An example is, “I'm writing to you today because climate change is really important. It must be addressed and we need to come up with more sustainable ways of living in order to reduce our carbon footprint.” and share your ideas."
6111b8bc982e6972a924ee7c,"Climate change has been a problem that we've been faced with as the world. Climate change is defined as the change of the climate for example more glaciers are melting,it's getting hotter than before. The main way to fight climate change is to plant more trees so they can absorb all the carbon dioxide and gas emissions from the world. Using more environmentally friendly products that do not cause any harm to the environment such as recyclable materials such as bottles and glasses. We can implement cars that move with batteries and require to car them instead of cars that release carbon dioxide.  Instead of big firms using coal to manufacture electricity which in turn releases carbon dioxide they can look at an alternative of producing electricity via solar panels which emit less gasses to the atmosphere.  We can use a system of recycling of the products like classify where the glasses,papers and bottles should be recycled and offer incentives to citizens that invest well in recycling. We as the citizens as the this world can do better without the government intervening and try to minimize and  do things that are environmentally friendly and will not harm the environment."
5bed50471f9cac0001734381,"Climate Change is a very complicated issue, because people don't believe to it or they are too lazy to actually do something. An idea would be to make recycling obligatory in countries where it isn't already, and pose a fair amount for fine to those who don't conform. Also, people do not recycle because they don't have a motivation to do so. Maybe a money incentive could work. It has to be an amount that won't be diregarded but also not too much money so people don't make it a profession or take advantage of others. Also, a lot of pressure has to be put to politicians, in order to implement more cautious measures and also force big polluting units (like factories) to adopt policies that are more eco friendly. Also, the use of fire should be taken in consideration, especially from junkyards and farms. People are used to burn a big amount of thrash or redundant weeds often, leading to more release of CO2, which affects the ozon layer. Finally, people need to be more careful about their wasting behavior. Beaches and natural sceneries all around the world are filled with thrash from tourists that disregard the rules. There has to be a stricter supervision, but also more organizations that clean beaches or the water. Those organizations must not be independent, but incorporated in the government, so their action can be more organized and efficient and also more funded. More creative ways can be achieved by using nudges, a technique that uses behavioral science to nudge people to certain behaviors."
600a9ab59e9b701db49fbec1,"Banning golf courses (waste of water), banning private planes, banning cruises, using water from treatment plants in agriculture and livestock, planting trees, create more gardens and natural parks, using more public transport in cities, prohibit cars in some zones, with some exceptions, banning swimming pools in homes, using irrigation in public spaces only at night, ending deforestation, eat less beef and pork and eat more vegetables (be more vegan and vegetarian), also eat less fish, use less single-use plastics, recycle more and reuse more materials, less consumerism, buy less clothes ( highly polluting industry).
Limit the use of water in homes and factories, bet more on renewable energies, mainly solar energy in homes, bet on wave energy and solar energy, investigate and bet more on hydrogen. Reduce hydropower to store more water in dams. Create more electric car charging stations, create water desalination plants and nuclear power plants for energy production, due to the greater demand for energy.
Bet on the thermal insulation of houses and buildings, invest in air conditioning, bet on more sustainable materials such as wood. 
I think these measures are good for the sustainability of the planet and that they look after the future of the next generations.
It was also important to try to plant some vegetation in arid areas such as the Sahara desert or the Middle East, areas without trees that would benefit from these measures. Ending coal-fired plants is also necessary as it is highly polluting, and gradually reducing the use of natural gas.
Bet more on electrical equipment and less on combustion engines."
5f15ed8fd44ced12e0336ff5,"One thing to fight climate change is eating less meat and diary products. It has a great impact on the planet and reduces your environmental influence as the carbon footprint of one cheesburger is equival to e.g. six times fish and chips. Another thing would be to leave your car at home and switch to public transportation or simple walks. Air pollution caused by exhaust fumes not only affects our planet, but also our health. Respecting and protecting green spaces is also very important. They provide multiple benefits, such as lowering air pollution, cooling overheated urban areas, and are important habitats for variety of animals. You can even start planting trees, either individually or as part of a collective. Shopping sustainable also helps our planet a lot. Supporting local businesses and buying seasonal foods reduce fossil fuel emissions and help to lower the usage of energy. You can even go a step further and grown your own vegetables. This also leads to another helpful tip is not to waste food. Avoid buying things you do not need or bulk-buying. Measure portions of your food before eating, be creative with leftovers or even make compost out of them. Shop and eat wisely! Not only this can save our planet but also save you some money. Remember, it is alway very important to start a climate conversation as well. Since people tend to trust friends and family the most, it is a good idea to pick up a conversation about climate change and how we can save our planet. It is always better to hear that from a peer than experts or scientist which we tend not to trust. "
60c1da4f43673b0d9446078e,"Our world is dying and a lot of people still don't get that there are various possibilities that can change it. I know a lot of people who blame huge comapnies of destroying the Earth and that they don't want to change their lifestyles just because they think they behaviour won't do much. I'm not saying that it's not a thing, but if everyone or at least some people would change they perspective it would really do a thing. Firstly we should think how what things we eat, by consuming less meat the CO2 pollution would be so much smaller, and also we can stop suffer of most of the animals. Secondly we should think twice before buying new thing: do we really need this? can we get this from second-hand? maybe we can ask our friends if they can share it with us? Another think is recycling and I am not only thinking about throwing things at a specific bin, but also about reusing stuff. Like maybe your jeans have a lot of stains, so maybe you should dye them, or that lamp that is not working anymore can be repaired or turned into some other ornament? All of it is not about making your life harder, but more sufficient and make you think about your decisions. When it comes to wider masses we can use a lot of different innovations that came to life in last years. Like drones- they can easily reach places we cannot and they can do stuff a single person would suffer to do in that amout of time they are doing. We could have drones that plant trees, that pick garbage, that controles weather there are no illigal garbege dump or illigal activites from comapanies, they can also check the about of air pollutions, if people are not smoking garbage in they hearths."
60eaac9e9b27ce557bd8fc58,"Climate change is firstly caused by mostly human beings due to their daily activities that end up being harmful onto the climate, examples of some of the activities that cause climate change are usage of cars ,chopping down of trees and burning of fossil fuels. Climate change can at times be harmful because it ends up giving unstable weather conditions such as an extremely hot temperature or even natural disasters, so the question is how do we fight climate change ? Climate change needs us as humans to change our ways of doing in order to bring the changes ,we can firstly start by decreasing usage of many cars daily ,Law can be created to say people should use buses or trains if in need of going wherever they want to go or even bicycle and only use cars for cases of emergency and that way we would have reduced a lot of traffic caused by cars everyday and it would be one step ahead of fighting climate change. The second one should be prohibiting people from chopping down forest trees just because they want to build something there ,many trees and removed for the purpose of building but at the same time the cutting down of trees causes climate change because we need trees in our daily lives as they provide us with oxygen. "
611da2edb4dd06832bb888b1,Firstly we need to know what causes climate change. Climate change is caused by air pollutants from steam factories and environmental pollutants like waste and rubbish this causes the disruption on ecosystem thus resulting in irregular order of nature which is Climate change. To prevent this further from happening we need to implement dynamo technology to divert from coal in making electricity.  Implement Green energy and passive design in our structures to stop burning fossils. We use sun energy for solar and at night we use the energy stored from solar to use in that way no coal will be of use. We have to implement the idea of cleanliness and what cleanliness can do for us as far as nature is concerned to try and make the society clean to avoid the environmental waste to make sure that government implement structures to assist with keeping the waste away from environment. We can use the already used technologies like solar wind but make sure that we improve it by it being not only dependent on wind but to store energy for when there's isn't enough wind to run electricity.   The main idea is to use nature for energy without burning fossils.
5eaeb365086d90570e8e538f,"To fight climate change we need to reevaluate our ideas towards mass creation of products and plantlife. Homogenisation through farming certain plants or animals in large swathes damages ecosystems irreparably. To counteract this, humans need to grow their own subsidence and return to smaller scale collectives that trade their own wares. We need to be rewarded for re-using items of technology rather than simply discarding them when they reach their sell-by date. The insistence of growth which makes the world a 'global village, needs to be replaced by returning our focus to growing our communities and feeding our ourselves, without necessarily becoming insular. We need laws in place that discourage our rapid consumption of products that need to be shipped around the world. It goes without saying, that our energy needs must be disinvested with fossil fuels, and replaced with renewable energies, such as solar, water and wind to generate the energy we require, but on the whole, we need to make our world smaller connective communities rather simply a global village.

6065dcc8bc4a1f1663e4d13b,"The best way to fight climate change is to modify little by little the world we live in wich because we already have many things that harm our environment. We humans have a huge impact on this so we need to change our habits. Reduce the use of cars on cities would be a significant change. We should stop deflorestation too because trees help us. If we try to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, oils and gas it will help us a lot. Agriculture doesnt help either because many animals produce methane wich will affect our planet. Its used nitrous oxide for fertilizers and they are not good either. So if we want to change this, we need to start small and improve all of the above so we can reduce the harm we do to our planet. Some countrys already contribute to this and we should all follow their example"

Again the main objective would be to create posters asking for help to raise climate ambition by painting with climate art. Encouraging the usage of energy wisely and save money too.. Mobilise for local climate action. Green my commute by encouraging reduction of transport emissions like flying less or using public transit or car-share. Start s climate conversation as solving climate change requires teamwork and finding common ground. Consuming less means wasting less and enjoying life more as too much of the the stuff we use id toxic and we don't share efficiently. the aim should be to focus on life's simple pleasures, spending time with nature and making a difference in society by providing purpose and belonging. The aim is to be more gentler to the earth by composting, upcycling, fixing and repurposing. Taking the initiative to invest in renewables and divest from fossil fuels. Even if one cannot install solar panels they will still be able to be part of the clean-energy economy by investing. Eating for a climate stable planet would also have a profound effect on the environment, this would take place by buying organic, growing own food or eating meat-free meals. Another positive effect would be getting politically active by taking action to reduce our individual carbon footprints. Green transition investments must accelerate the decarbonization of all aspects of our economy. Green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth. Green economy making societies and people more resilient through a transition that is fair to all and leaves no one behind. In the long term, higher temperatures entail risks of negative consequences for the environment, and so for human beings as well.

5e82fb37e833ed000a41a42c,"It is a fact that we are running out of time to fight climate change. According to scientists, we are quickly reaching a tipping point we can't come back from. So, what can we do?
When fossil fuel companies produce the majority of greenhouse gases, this ought to be everyone's focus. Looking at other factors or individuals is a distraction. Everyone needs to work together to bring down the systems that keep oil companies at the top and churning out carbon dioxide.
Governments need to pass legislation to close down oil companies and create funding for clean energy sources. They also need to address the rampant corruption that protects these companies for example 1) preventing deals between them and government officials, 2) banning them from attending events such as COP and, 3) making procedures more transparent.
Citizens need to vote for the governments that make this happen and protest the ones that don't. They can take other steps such as not using banks that fund fossil fuel companies and reducing their own carbon footprint too by going vegan and not driving. However, it is important not to put too much emphasis on individual action as climate deniers use this as a diversion tactic. 
In an ideal situation, all governments and individuals will immediately seek to use only clean energy so the demand for fossil fuels is drastically cut. This involves further research into solar, and wind and initiatives to provide poorer communities who cannot afford the change with clean energy. 
The media constantly looks for new fashionable ways to fight climate change but the solution is the same now as it was sixty years ago. We need to stop using fossil fuels and we need to do it now."
61140ecd6c72bb8ce54d0ac8,The reality that climate change is part of our daily talk and experiences has dawned. Whether switches on the Tv to watch the news or go on the internet to read a few news articles the reality of climate change can not be ignored. It is sad that we as human beings are the primary cause of this phenomenon and are the solution as well. Technology has brought about sustainable options on how to curb the adverse effects of climate change. Transportation is key in fighting climate change. I would invent an engine that rubs on water as we have noted that fossil fuels have adverse effects on our planet. This engine would use a resource that is abundantly available and is easily recyclable. Construction trends have shown as well that the industry contributes to CO2 emission sin the environment. I would would invent a cement and steel alternative which is purely plant based. This will ensure a renewable source of construction raw materials and would avoid unnecessary importation and transportation of materials as people can construct with locally available materials. Urban areas have become concrete jungles and hence a limit or a reverse of this phenomenon will be critical. I would introduce cities that function and as forests. Limit individual vehicular traffic. Mass public transportation running on the water engine would only serve these new cities. Clothing and furniture in this city will also be entirely made from plant based products. The use of all fossil fuels will be banned in this city.
60fdc6bd99694fa57bdc303e,"Climate change has always been the center topic discussed among most people, especially youngsters nowadays because they are the ones who realize how dire the consequences will be if this problem is not addressed properly. 
First, fighting it comes from people themselves in the first place, the awareness of the problem and what it leads to is the key to any solution. People should know that everything they do has either a set back or can be an asset element in the fight. They should be educated about climate change and ways of fighting it which can start from schools. How would people know the alternative of many things they use? For example, they should be given all the information, like how to switch energy sources and to what, what carbon emissions actually cause, how to choose eco-friendly products more often and the easiest would be recycling.  
Second, we have to stop dealing with the problem in easiness, the situation should be discussed as it is, without using terms that makes it a normal or easy problem. We have to use terms that reflects what is actually happening and how catastrophic the consequences will be if we did not work all together against this.  It is not a high temperature season, it is not a normal summer, it is climate change and global warming that causes severe droughts and floods. 
Last but not least, the alternatives should be easily accessed with low prices, we can't expect from people to pay more for alternatives. The governments especially environment ministries should start paving the way  into a new era of eco-friendly lives, planting more trees, recommending better choices of consumption and of course not forgetting that laws and penalties are an ultimate solution in this fight when people fail to cooperate.

5abd8d6ba3ba7a0001b4602b,"The best way to fight against something is to know what we're fighting against or for, therefore there's no better way to start a war against climate change than to learn what we can do against it. Starting to learn, for example, about carbom emissions is a good first step, because you're actively reading about a problem - which can lead you to some possible solutions, like using more public transportation or, if you need to drive your car, at least use it for more than just yourself. Even learning more about green power and switching to it, slowly. When it comes to saving the planet, it's all about being thoughtful of everything and everyone, never leaving your mark aside. What you do is just as important as what everybody else does and every single step and help counts. There's only one planet Earth, learn what you can do to save it. 
But don't just save all the knowledge to yourself - share it! With your friends and family, with the world! Helps others getting as inspired as you are to save your home planet! Inspire them to, for example, go to work by bike if they can! Or even change the way they eat slightly so they feed themselves better, healthier and in a more Earth conscious way! Show them local markets where they can buy organic vegetables and fruits instead of going to the same supermarkets. Be the change you want to see in the rest of the world and inspire that change to happen. Make the change happen, starting by yourself. See the world as it could be instead of simply what it is! "
60faab394a1729764adb9a29,"Our planet is at risk at reaching a no point of return if we do not aggressively stem the incidence of climate change within the coming decade. At this point everything is at stake and all hands should be on deck to working towards fighting climate change and perhaps even restoring the planet’s equilibrium. Governments need to be on board and they need to take the lead by creating an enabling environment that include radical environmental legislation and policy changes that will force industry to comply. This could include taxes, fees and profit-linked fines being imposed for transgressors. There should be independent oversight of manufacturers’ compliance processes.  
Governments can also control the amount of energy utilised through a variety of means.
With an enabling environment being created by the State, the private sector can also play its part in the following ways:
-        Exploration and adoption into the use of wind technology
-        The exploration and adoption of renewable energy on a smaller scale for individual households such as using trash
-        Solar energy
-        Nuclear energy
-        Harnessing of water resources to generate energy
-        The promotion of energy conservation techniques for both industry and households
There is also need to invest heavily in the research and development of not only new sources of energy and energy conservation. Other techniques may include sustained reforestation efforts and the creation of green cities.  In all endeavours to combat climate change there also needs to be clear, concise and accurate communication to the public at large so that the international community at large is on the same page.

5db9870052e7df000a11af99,"By being caused by and affecting everyone, it becomes everyones responsibility to address climate change. It's very easy for the individual to dismiss the consequences of their actions as insignifcant in the light of big corporations, and vise versa in simply say ""we're supplying demand!"" The resulting ideas to fight climate change touch on all societal levels.

Firstly, the individual. The obvious choice, as has been realised for decades now, is promoting plant-based life styles. Primarily their diet, which is the most influencial, but also most other forms of animal products gained from high density farms, and land that's had it's biodiversity diminished entirely for grass-grazing. The alternative is dramatically reducing the amount of land used for crops to feed animals, and instead returning that land to wildlife-promoting wilderness. Then, of course, come the steps that are easier to accept for most people because they don't actually involve much personal change; flying less, taking public transport where availble, having less children, buying less. Overall, consume less, waste less.

For corporations, naturally, since capitalistic mindsets have created this environment, and the determinetal effects won't be felt by corporations until it's too late to actually address, the only truly effective course of action is eye-wateringly high regulations on unsustainable business practices, and awe-inspiring, glowing promotion of sustainable practices. Naturally it's the roles of governments to facilitate the societal shift away from the consumer practices that maintain the climate-change-enabling conditions we're in now. Socialism and communism would be a sensible end goal. If everyone lives in a manner where appreciation of the environmental source of your goods is a fundamental idea to your life style, then who will conciously take steps to destroy that environmental source?

Ultimately it's a matter of education. Educating people on the consequences of their actions and the source of those actions can help them, hopefully, make the base-line decision to act in both their own personal best interest, and in the interest of the global society we all invariably live in."

This then forces us to save the Earth for ourselves and future generations to come. It may seem like a task which may be taken at government level, but that's not entirely true, growing a tree at your home, fighting deforestation, commute using busses or bicycles, switching to greenpower are all means we can each contribute towards limiting our carbon emissions, in our respective households and society. The truth is though, as mere mortals, we can only do so much, a huge responsibility lies with our respective governments and global leaders, the existing carbon tax are clearly not enough as 7 continue to ravage our ozone layer, exposing us to harm radiations from the sun. Of course some of it is beyond human control, we can hardly do anything to stop the melting of Antarctica and rising sea level but therein lies the responsibility in all of us to our bit in order to save the human race."

This can be done by reducing our dependence on electricity and fossil fuels and using more clean gases like solar energy for lighting.  fighting climate change is everyone's responsibility. dropping just a piece of plastic on the ground causes climate change. we should ensure we preserve our natural resources like water, and trees and avoid cutting trees where necessary, and plant more trees. natural habitats must remain balanced always. we should normalize using recyclable materials every time. we must reduce our carbon emissions and use less packaging at all times.  instead of driving we can walk or bike more to reduce our emissions.  how if we can change our lightbulbs from fluorescent to LEDs.

Our solutions are not really stopping climate change, but rather only delay the consequences. In my opinion, we shouldn't leave this task to individual persons. Instead the governments and big companies should be first who do something. If we can make healthy things cheaper, then people will switch just easier and more natural, teaching them won't be even required and that's because majority of Earth's population is poor. As for actual ideas to fight climate changes, we must finally start using renewable power sources in big scale. Wind and sun are still generating less than we need. Also, maybe it's time to start trying less known ways like restoring oceans by providing them with necessary elements. Next thing, I would like to talk about is pollution. I think, we made already good progress in this case, but we must focus on reasons why pollution even happens. Instead of ""cleaning"" the world, we should stop generating so much garbage, that is: plastic bottles etc. I don't think we can make everyone to follow the rules, so at least we should make breaking the rules less impactful for health for our planet. Last thing, I would like to add, is to watch what big organizations do. We must remember that huge companies like for example WHO, still need to make somehow money to exist and I think that can raise some questions. Do they really care about our health or they think about money first? All information should be available to public if they want us to trust them."

1. Change the way electricity is being produced from coal and switch to renewable energy, this should be standard. The use of Solar Panels should be compulsory within households.

2. Switch to electric cars. This point connects to the 1st one in a sense that electric cars will reduce harm to the environment which will then make the environment more healthy and in that way the production of electricity will be sustainable. 

3. Come up with laws that will incriminate anyone that damages the environment. For example, littering should be regarded as a crime in all countries. 

Basically, my whole point is that if we were to go the natural route, the Earth will be a better place. What's causing clime change is the production of all these man-made things in the name of ""making profit"". "

One that I've been thinking about for maybe a while is the viabilization of producing meat and animal's derivates throught renewable energies, such as the wind and the waves strength, in a system that could use biological resources and ways, like water and winds strength to push and improve the production. Per example, by using the winds, we could get factories to start their machines and engines, not using any electricity or carbon or any other subsidiary matter for this effect."

5cfba9da04fd2c001941a7e3,"As ideas to combat climate change, less individual transport (such as cars and motorcycles) could be used and more public transport (such as buses, trains, subways, trams) could be used. More trees, plants and autotrophic living beings could also be planted. It would also be important to clean forests (to reduce fires and thus gas releases), oceans (clean up plastics, microplastics, nanoparticles) and the biosphere in general (garbage on the streets, for example). In addition, we should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using less transport or walking more, or by reducing industrialization. If possible, try to switch to an electric company with zero carbon or renewable energy policies. It is still an excellent idea to install solar panels or solar collectors. It is essential to turn off appliances and lights when not in use, and always choose more efficient ones with lower energy consumption.
It would also be important to reduce the consumption of meat and milk. Livestock is responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. In this way, we can eat more plant-based meals, in addition to improving our health, we are improving the planet and our quality of life. It is also important to consume sustainable and locally sourced products (our place of residence or close by, in markets, for example). Many cosmetics, food and hygiene products have their raw materials extracted by processes that also emit toxic gases. Finally, it is important to make the people around us aware of the cause.

Secondly, businesses which remove damaging products such as plastics and fossil fuels from there every day running should be rewarded with tax reliefs and other financial schemes.

This can best be achieved through awareness-raising. In a highly globalised and capitalistic society such as ours, it is the consumers who make the difference. Convincing consumers of the importance of a green transition is therefore the way to achieve it as quickly as possible. Some ideas on how to achieve this are therefore related to pop culture: music, TV shows, catchy testimonials that can target different age groups in the population. It should not seem like an imposition from above, it should rather start as a fashion, and continue as the right way to be seen in society. We will win when the bicycle is seen as more attractive than the car, and the electric car more than the petrol-powered one. Just as cigarettes have been banned from movies, so clean energy must be pushed as much as possible in new ones. Attract by imitation, not by imposition--this is the way. It would also be useful to try to satisfy the fears of the most stubborn objectors. For example, a large part of the deniers is also xenophobic. It might be essential to point out how a continued rise in temperatures would lead to humanitarian crises, which would in turn increase the influx of immigrants.

Our population is growing rapidly and our energy needs will always be upon us, hence we need ways to meet the energy demands while also supplying clean energy. We can use renewable energy sources for example things like solar energy, synthetic gas, wind energy etc.

We can use Hydrogen to fuel our electric cars. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table and it is the cleanest burning fuel. This means that the use of hydrogen in the car motors could our one of many solutions we can rely on. In order to shy away from carbon emitting vehicles we could rely more on public transport to reduce the total amount of carbon emissions.

The more we use public transport, the higher the number of cars not being used hence more reduction in carbon emissions. This simply means that the fewer the number of people driving, the less emissions we can expect.

Another factor to consider is using more renewable energy sources like your wind turbines which use wind power to generate energy and this is another alternative to reducing the amount of carbon emissions.  Using solar energy can also assist in reducing climate change as these uses the sun as the energy source which means that there is no carbon emissions being experienced in this case. "

611e58f3b7cfe10fe9eef3df,"As we all know climate change is becoming a big issue concerning Earth. I'll be talking about ideas on how to fight climate change.

But before i get into how we can prevent climate change, we need to understand what it is.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

Burning fossil fuels causes greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures. Leading to change in the Earth's atmosphere and change in weather patterns.

Greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

How can we fight Climate change?
It is our responsibility to fight climate change as inhabitants of Earth. We can use Bicycles more instead of driving.  Plant a tree A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. Use less hot water. It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year)."

(2) Reducing land polution by not litering, recycling/reusing things such as plastic and opting for biodegradable packaging. (3) Educating people(young and old) on climate change and global warming as well as how we can help each other fight it. (4) Holding clean-up campaigns to help clean our oceans, land and communities of any waste. (5) holding people who willingly litter accountable through fines etc. and having posters everywhere so that people see and learn about climate change everywhere they go. (6) Reducing our carbon footprint, planting more trees and reducing deforestation. (7) Encouraging more healthier living for all persons and going green. (8) encouraging more eco-friendly inventions that will not cause any damage to our planet and turning the ones we already have into more ecofriendly options. (9) Using social media to spread information about climate change, how it is affecting our planet, how that will affect our future generations and all that can be done to fight it.

There is food insecurity due to climate changes which have negatively impacted on our agricultural production. Animal husbandry and animal diseases has affected beef, poultry and other animal farming.

Our general health has also been affected due to toxics in the air.

We therefore need to reduce dangerous green house gas emissions by embracing alternative  renewable energy. We can use Solar and wind energy and avoid Coal which is commonly used to power our Industries.

We should also try to use natural manure in our farming instead of the dangerous chemicals that deplete our soils and poison it. Eventually rendering the soils poor and unproductive.

We should also plant more trees and vegetation to prevent desertification and to purify our environment and keep it clean. This will bring more rainfall and thus improve our Agricultural production.

We should also keep our Oceans, Seas and Rivers clean by stopping to dump Industrial waste and other harmful substances. This will keep our marine life safe and provide more food for us and also conducive environments.

United Nations should come up with rules and Regulations that must be adhered to  by all Member nations in fighting climate changes. There should be strict penalties for any defaulting members and heavy embargoes. This might bring some sanity to our world which is facing danger of climate change.

5e2df2855e01ef3e5d01ab58,"I believe that the best way to fight climate change is to provide education for as many people as possible. The biggest hurdle we face is ignorance. If we can teach more people what climate change is, what causes it and why it's bad, I believe we can affect politics by voting, where the real change can happen.
Which leads to my next suggestion which is to engage in your country's politics. Vote for the politicians that are active in the climate debate, and hold them accountable if they get enough votes. 

The next big one is our energy. We have to stop using fossil fuels. Instead, we should focus our research on green and renewable energy sources that eventually can replace the fossil fuel industries that are hurting our planet. Additionally, we should reduce our emissions caused by us traveling. We have to further develop electric vehicles and reduce their cost so that they can be more commonplace, and replace gas-driven vehicles. I hope that we will eventually even replace our planes using jet fuel with electric ones. Until we develop our electric technology, we should focus on reducing the emissions we already put out by encouraging traveling by trains, buses, cycling and walking for their commutes, rather than taking their gas fueled cars wherever they are going.

Finally, I believe that planting more trees and more plants, and stopping illegal deforestation is something really important to clean the air and protect our planet’s biodiversity. Even if you only build your own little jungle on your balcony, every bit helps and this should be encouraged.

6161fccfedbe31acceb97d7e,"There are a multiple ways in which we can fight and I must say it something that is not as complicated as we might think. it just needs self-discipline. below are the various ways we can try to follow to fight climate change:
Plant trees, recycle more, use less hot water because we might be aware that it takes so much energy to warm water, cut back on flying, spread the word on all the advantages of fighting climate change, focus on planet friendly investments, eliminate food waste, divest, i and if possible stick to using LED Lighting.

One of the most important things is to really consider changing transportation. one billion of reggenative agriculture might save as much CO2 as complete overhaul of the world's transformation networks, both commercial and private. More than all of the emissions from airlines combined, commercial vehicles alone are responsible for 6% of global emissions. While individuals can not overnight transform the transportation, shipping, and aviation sectors, we demand that they do so by using public transformation, driving electric or hybrid vehicles, and limiting the number of trips that we take.

We should also consider improving on insulation. improved insulation is among the easiest, most affordable strategies to fight the climate change. Up to 35% of heat can lost through the walls of older houses. modern insulation helps you save money and reduce emissions by lowering lowering the energy needed to heat your home.

People should as well avoid anything that can cause fire as much as they can. if we want to purchase wood, it is better to also look for wood that has a seal or certification attesting to sustainable origin.

Offer train connections with night sleep possibility, the infrascture may need to be upgraded but if we dont have time to wait, the travelling can wait. 
Ban cars out of the cities, by making streets only accessible to bicycles and pedestrians, see the example of Amesterdam if we compare it from today to 40 years ago.
Impose by law the remote work, and make companies pay a tax for employee comute kms. Provide incentives for the companies when they have employes working from home or low commute (like working a shared office space near home).

Every city should have for each 10k habitants should have a community or local produced vegetables for example, with a certain size.  This could be a community garden or explored by companies. But food should when possible be produced locally.  

The area occupied by trees should be increased by 30%, even if old building space have to be sent down to create parks, the main goal should be reached.

Every country in the world needs to identify their carbon footprints and the solutions to that. Most countries have aged infrastructure and factories which is further damaging our planet. Us as individuals need to take it upon ourselves to make a positive change in the world and force our governments to make changes to benefit our planet. Firstly our government needs to educate people on global warming and the impact our actions have on our planet. We need to approach climate change with a more direct approach.Communities need to get together on a global stage and shame companies that are not making an effort to change their carbon footprints. Even if we have to boycott companies that are not  making an effort thus forcing them to make a change.
We need to realize the direction we are heading in now, there will be no planet for the human race.
The decisions we make today will decide whether our children and grandchildren get to grow up on a dead Grey planet or on a healthy green planet.
Governments need to implement green energy. Maybe giving the citizens an incentive and rewards programs to adapt to a more clean and healthy climate will motivate people to do more.
Our governments needs to encourage people to recycle, plant  more trees, save water, and buy more sustainable products.

First of all, if we want to succeed we have to work together. This time the teamwork is more important than ever. Most of you probably have kids or younger siblings - and what do they like? Pinwheels. And what also looks like a pinwheel? Wind turbines. If we just installed them in the right environment we could reduce carbon pollution by almost 70%! 
But wind is not our only ally - there are also water turbines and so much more! It would be a crime not to mention solar panels, of course. So what's stopping us from installing them on the roofs in the urbanized areas? 
But let's not forget about one of the most important factors - trees. For example, we could try to make it more profitable for people to plant more trees on their parcels. Make it mandatory for city councils to plant two trees in place of cutting down one. 
There are studies that show us the massive impact that bamboo forests have when it comes to CO2 reduction. They are also great substitute for trees when it comes to paper making but not only that! Bamboo can also serve as a replacement for timber, concrete and steel. How amazing is that? And because it's a grass, not a tree, it grows fast - which means fast-regenerating resource. "

To fight climate change one of these causes could be addressed. Some of the direct causes of climate change include burning of fossil fuels which emits green house gases, deforestation, and farming of livestock. 
One of the ways of mitigating climate change could by reducing the amount of livestock farmed. Keeping in mind that research is being done.  This would be done in favor of plant based diets.

Including: using energy efficient appliances in our homes, improving the way our modes of transport operate by switching to electric transport rather than using petrol and diesel vehicles, improving our farming  by reducing meat consumption and encouraging more vegan diets. We can also restore our nature by planting more trees and looking after our environment. Reducing the use of plastic because it does not break down easily. We can protect our oceans and forests, the ocean absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide being a threat to sea creatures. While our forests play an important role in fighting against climate change, destroying our tress results in a huge amount of carbon consumption. And lastly we can reduce just how much the human population consumes, this includes food, fashion, and other lifestyle choices we make that affect our environment daily.

A boiled brain is not a good brain!

I will propose a few ideas to help ameliorate climate change below.

Firstly we must address over population. Reducing the amount of children a couple has is the single most effective way to reduce carbon footprint that an individual can take int he future. to this end we should fund education, particularly for girls, as a more educated female population have fewer children. We should also fund informative, science based sex education and free contraception. 

Secondly transport, we need to increase subsidies for public transport, especially electric public transport and increase its frequency and significantly reduce its price to the consumer so that it becomes a far cheaper, truly viable and attractive alternative to car ownership. Aeroplane travel should be reduced if possible, perhaps with a rationing system.

Thirdly, food production. Animals raised for meat should be reduced in number and meat consumption cut. We should invest in research in lab grown meat, and meat alternatives. We should invest in high rise hydroponic farming to save space given over to arable farming."
60c048ca962103e0da201a34,"Climate change needs to be fought on multiple fronts and multiple levels. It needs to be fought on the macro level through new energy sources and technological innovation. To do this both governments and businesses need to be involved and be encouraged and incentivized to be at the forefront of change. But to truly affect this change, we need to start at the micro-level. We need to instill in tomorrows leaders of state and business the drive and the desire to fight this fight in the way in which it needs to be fought and in the way in which today's generation is failing to do. We do this by instigating a shift in perspective. By placing a high demand on sustainability and a disdain for mass consumerism of 'fast' products. Blend a desire for a more traditional and sustainable existence blended with technology over the disposable existence we find ourselves in today. This should be done through the influence of social media and the various technology platforms that inform so much of todays generation. A campaign of influence on awareness of the planet and its climate, platforms promoting innovative technologies and collaborative thinking initiatives should be advanced. The fight for climate change will be waged by tomorrows generation and the means to inspire and equip them lies in the algorithms and platforms of the various social medias, apps and screen learning."

Though evident enough and affecting us all, however, we cannot always point out the problems without thinking about the solutions. Creativity and innovativeness are needed to fight climate change. From a narrow perspective, climate change is caused by the ""fading-away"" of the Ozone layer. A strategy would be to innovate and come up with ways to replenish the Ozone layer, by the way, we have all the science we need to do that. First we could create Ozone in the lab, build a space-station-like or satellite-like structure, load it with O3 (Ozone), then take it up to this structure where it is going to be released gradually, at a much higher rate than the rate at which sulphurs and carbon substances which deplete the Ozone layer reach there.

We live in a world of new technology and a lot of chemicals and most people do not care if they cause global warming they just want anything that will make their lives easier so here are ways to fight or reduce climate change.

It is high time people start using bicycle or walking for a change and drive less, use fragrances or sprays that have no or less chlorofluorocarbons. Use solar energy power, plant more trees and create more green houses, cut consumption, eat plant based and create less food waste.

Recycling by acquiring virgin resources will also help and shop sustainably by buying less because while we're saving money we're also saving the planet by reducing and reusing we cut down on the amount we contribute to landfills. Save coral reefs by packing smartly for your beach vacation also trade in for an electric car. 

Awareness campaigns and advertises are a good way to spread the word, from television, radio to social media even especially by hiring influencers to inform their millions of follwers about something that could save the world for a change.

Teaching our peers who have little to no knowledge about climate change is a great way to multiply effort. Considering carbon offsets and educating people about carbon emissions is also extremely important so people can buy offsets from a specific activity like international flights or buy packages with names like ''Green wedding carbon offsets'' because understanding climate change will disproportionally impact our communities as it's an important step towards battling global warming and creating a world we can respect and protect green spaces as well."

In 2022 there are many ways to fight these catastrophic happenings, but everyday every government puts off the urge to do something because of their greed and their relationships with big enterpreneurs. I can list some important solutions.
Firstly, we have to quit using non renewable resources that foul up our planet. I see that is difficult to apply because petrol, carbon and others of these resources make enterpreneurs earn money. They are worried that, with an ecological transition, they'll lose their earning. An ecological transition is expensive but is worth it in the end.
Then, we can reduce the pollution created by intensive farming: are we willing to reduce the consumption of meat? If yes, Earth will thank us. Every land used for intensive farming is land taken from forests, and we can save litres of water.
Last: recycling is the way. We have lands of plastic in our oceans. States nedd to improve disposal of resources and plastic, there is an urge to reduce the production of plastic.
We all have to take part in this ecological transition, but if political figures do nothing about it, we have no power. Everything starts from them."

2. Extensive use of mud, instead of concrete, for building single storey houses or adjacent constructions to existing buildings. 
3. Extensive use of remote working where applicable to reduce energy consumption and commuting.
4. Minimise working days for companies to four days per week, in order to further reduce energy consumption and commuting.

First of all, we could all continue the lines of reusing, reducing and recycling. Let's take fashion as an example to apply this: we could reuse the clothes our parents used back in their days (since fashion is a recurring thing and what was cool in the past is always coming back) and stop buying fast fashion items that are not only affecting our planet in terms of pollution and waste but also damaging societies and violating human rights. We could also exchange clothes with our friends and loved ones or buy in second-hand stores (recycling) to reduce our mark and our consumption in fast fashion.
Second of all, we could continue to follow other suggestions such as taking shorter showers to reduce our water consumption or using public transportation or riding a bike instead of owning a car. 
Nonetheless, what we really need is public policies that punish big companies that are a big part of the problem and have not taken measures in order to reduce their CO2 emissions. We need to protest and make them take care of the situation and hold them accountable for their actions. We can all help by making little changes in our day-to-day lives but if big corporations continue to damage our planet the way they are there none of our changes will matter. "

There are however, many unique ways in which we can combat climate change. Plastics are a killer when it comes to climate change and so this could be a key point to focus on. It is the plastics industry that uses a huge amount of fossil fuel and they are extremely unsustainable. Instead of plastic packaging shops could introduce bring your own containers for fruit and veg etc so that they are not using plastic packaging or instead use paper bags. There are also ways in which different compounds can be extracted from more sustainable materials such as trees in order to create plastic like material that is far more sustainable.  Upcycling furniture may seem like it has no impact but reusing old items and making them seem new again or giving them a different purpose means that individuals are less likely to need to go out and purchase new items that have been created using fossil fuels.

That said there are things which we can do to try to minimise the impact of our species on the planet as a whole. One of the biggest ways to do this will be to adopt more wholescale use of nuclear power to produce the world's energy. On top of this would come intense research into the safe use of fission power - to an extent that we can produce the majority of our world's energy needs through these means.

Both preventing and reversing a catastrophic rise in temperature around the world is therefore essential. Some have already been suggested such as carbon sequestration, however that can only be effective if we build, in every nation and continent plants that will continuously scrub it from the air. Another potential idea is to make as much of the built up world able to reflect sunlight back into space. A way to do this is to paint all roofs white. Finally, I suggest that we station mirrors and blockers at the la Grange point so that for one or two hours per day, or more if needed, we can block sunlight to the earth and create a false night. Since the earth cools when it is dark, this would be an effective way to cool the global temperature, giving us a breathing space in which to deploy other measures to create a permanent decrease."

These emissions can be very harmful to human health for example causing respiratory problems within the lungs. To fight against climate change, we can try and lessen the emissions of carbon dioxide by reducing the number of cars or traffic on the road, which can either be by carpooling with other people.  If we can also try to reduce the use of petrol in the cars and probably create more electric cars that can be used permanently. industries can also find ways since they deal with various ways of burning coal and fossil fuels to manufacture their products. They can investigate other means of moving away from the emissions of carbon dioxide and stop the use of coal and fossil fuels.

Firstly everyone needs to be educated accurately about the sources of climate damage and get the factors into perspective. What can the individual do, or companies, or government regulations, without removing choice from consumers? We all think we want to help but how many are actually willing to give up the things they love, like meat eating, and use or personal cars? I think each individual could be charged with a personal plan, maybe like a New Year's resolution to make appropriate changes to their lifestyle. I'd start with schoolchildren's awareness and taking care not to brainwash kids (as I fear may be happening currently) I'd promote a whole school/community initiative to learn feasible changes and make it fun, with challenges, local events, and easy engagement.
As for governments, clear disincentives eg high taxation could be employed for fossil-fuel using cars. Grants should be available for insulation and upgrading of home heating systems. The UK, as an island, should be using more tidal power, which is 100% renewable, sustainable and frankly perfect. Push for a Severn Barrier! And use The Wash.

Nets of some sort should be strategically placed in the sea to trap all the plastic and dirt that contaminates the sea and biodegradable plastic should be used for packaging, shopping and other stuff uses the toxic plastic we currently use. Businesses found to be using plastic should be heavily fined. The production of plastic should be made illegal to discourage its use and production.
For every delivery made, businesses should plant a certain number of trees to offset their emission and besides electric cars, cars should use other alternatives for fuel or power, again the car manufacturers can be given an incentive for their role in the climate change fight.
Faecal matter has been used as a fertilizer, maybe some of those poop properties can be used to create a form of fuel or plastic can be used to create fuel without causing any harm to the climate.

To do so, it is important to have policies and practices in place to ensure that industries do not excessively release their wastes. Enforcing fines and penalties on those companies that continuously add to air pollution and the trapping of greenhouse gases should be made to pay up. When they are aware that their irresponsibility as a price associated with it, they will be encouraged to reduce their contribution and as a result, reduce the impact of climate change. Individual members of society should also be encouraged to become aware about their carbon footprint. With the introduction of electric cars and the many other ways to minimize emissions into the atmosphere, more awareness surrounding the importance of these ventures should be communicated to the regular person. They should be informed about their contributions to climate changes and the relevant changes they can make to combat it. If each person is motivated to become more green, climate change can become a thing of the past. If we all can reduce, reuse and recycle, it will have a ripple effect on one of the main challenges we face."
5ebd495e39fb6f017b95054a,"At our most recent brainstorm session, we came up with a number of ideas to combat climate change. These ideas may not all be implementable immediately, and some could be considered idealistic or improbably. However, while they may not be implementable in themselves, they could offer discussion points and help generate further, practical ideas that take us in the same direction and help reduce emissions/mitigate climate change. It would also be necessary to obtain buy in across the spectrum of governments, businesses and individuals. Ideas include:
A complete ban on the use of petrol and diesel vehicles (delayed until this could be practical, eg 2040)
Limiting people to two flights a year (except in exceptional circumstances). This could be limited to leisure flights.
Limiting the amount of meat people can purchase/consume
Introducing levies on face-to-face business meetings requiring air travel to encourage the use of online meetings. 
A ban on all intensive farming (arable and animal based)
Reducing internet storage limits
Greater publicity for the environmental cost of the internet/emails, etc, with data published openly, transparently and regularly
Rationing/restricting use of the internet
Placing a limit on the number of emails any one person can store
A ban on all deforestation
Reducing the number and size of ocean-going tankers to reduce diesel usage
A ban on all new coal mines
A ban on all new developments of oil fields
Transitioning to a local, rather than global, economy

We believe these ideas offer starting points for serious discussions on more radical ways to combat climate change. "
613f59d7f0f631a278aca6e8,"Climate change refers to long term changes in the climate that last for decades, centuries, or longer. Some ideas to fight climate change would be to decrease carbon dioxide emission, meaning people should use public transports more often so that there are less cars on the road. You can also plant something in your home. To reduce the use of plastics make sure to bring your own mug where ever you go. Recycling is also a key to fighting climate change. We could also stop using fossil fuels by changing our main energy sources to clean renewable energy. We could also turn lights off in unused rooms. Pay attention to your shopping, for instance you can buy a 5 liter of water instead of many 500ml bottled water. We can also repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them away."
5f108dea719866356702d26f,"Climate change affects all of us, and we cannot allow it to affect the earth in an irreversible way. Leaving aside the climate-fighting aspects of changing the energy mix of entire countries, climate levies, co2 sales, etc. we as individuals do not have a huge impact. However, it is worth starting with ourselves, our habits, our actions on a daily basis! This we can change, it's worth starting to save water, even if it's when you brush your teeth turn off the tap, watering your weeds, use rainwater! Do you move everywhere by car? Try walking, or go there by bike. Each of us has habits that do not serve our planet. Remember we don't have an option b, a spare planet, some substitute. You're probably not elon musk and you're not going to leave earth even tomorrow by swapping it for mars :) So take this advice to heart, promote good habits to others, do you want your children's children to live in some post-apocalyptic scenery that was not caused by nuclear war, asteroid strikes but by ourselves? And this is the worst case scenario, that we have brought this fate upon ourselves, it could have been prevented but we didn't!"
60f9baa99f49184f083a9ce8,"The following essay will cover a variety of ideas to fight climate change. Firstly, speaking out to those in power is a great place to start. Let your local council members and mayors know that you support acting against climate change. Actions to cut carbon emissions will benefit other regional problems including enhancing air quality and public health, creating jobs, and lowering inequality. Secondly, cutting what we consume and how we waste is very important. As consumers, everything we use leaves a carbon footprint. We should avoid fast fashion and single-use items, and try not to buy more than we require. Look around for used or durable products that endure a long time. Use your purchasing power wisely by sticking with companies that support your new environmental goals. Make an effort to reduce waste and instead repair and reuse. By giving them to a good cause or selling them, you can give discarded goods a new lease on life. Give brands your comments if you believe they are utilizing excessive packaging; some will take it seriously. Thirdly, try reducing your energy use, and bills. You can reduce your energy use at home, your carbon impact, and your energy costs by making small behavioral changes: Put on an additional layer of clothing and lower the heat by one or two degrees. When not in use, turn off the lights and all appliances. Change lightbulbs out for LEDs or other energy-efficient lighting. Make little adjustments to your hot water usage, such as switching to a water-saving shower head. Finally, a change in diet such as eating less meat and dairy could be beneficial in multiple ways. One of the best methods to lessen your influence on the environment is to cut out meat and dairy products. A high-fibre, plant-based diet may be beneficial for both your physical and mental health. Reduce or cut back on the amount of meat you eat, especially red meat, which has the biggest environmental impact. Also, cut back on dairy products or substitute non-dairy options. To lessen the carbon emissions from transit, preservation, and prolonged refrigeration, try to pick locally farmed, fresh produce that is in season. By implementing the above ideas, we could each make an impact towards the fight against climate change."

Do not forget that you have to take care of hygiene every day. One by one, we force stores to sell beverages only in glass bottles - such a drink tastes much better! In addition, we set up bottle return machines that offer discounts on subsequent purchases in a given network. Then we severely punish brands for smoking clothes. Let's dress the homeless - they also deserve to be fashionable. In addition, for their saving our planet in relation to the more affluent part of society, they should be rewarded with ecological food. In relation to drivers, we will increase fuel prices so that they reduce environmental pollution to a minimum. Owners of hybrid or electric vehicles get greater discounts when making purchases at gas stations and in automotive chain stores. Owners of other electric vehicles get a limited amount of free meals every month at selected gas stations. For offering remote work, which also helps our planet, every employer deserves a week's leave at the expense of his employees working only stationary. Often, cash payers should incur higher commission costs when paying for non-ecological forms of payment. For much greener contactless payments, each bank's customer should receive 20% one-time returns of some cash and dedicated thanks for caring for our future. All organic products are sold cheaper to reduce the water footprint."
6023df50d5c2d7069115de3f,"What is Climate change? Climate change is a long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. It used to be nature, but since human activities have been the main driver of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil) produces heat trapping gases. They are some ways in which we may reduce climate change but some of these ways are expensive to access. Cutting on pollution helps not to release toxic gases in to the air and the environment as well. We could use renewable resources such as solar panels instead of using electricity. Protecting our environment by not cutting down trees and rather planting more trees to help the ecosystem. Most people enjoy the joy of driving luxuries cars and enjoying the comfort not knowing that they are contributing to global warming  causing climate change. Eating less meat and dairy also helps reduce climate change. "

The affects of climate change are damaging and in order to fight climate change every single person on this world should be knowledgeable enough to know the harm they are causing to the world and this will help them to seek ways to reduce their contribution towards  climate change. By raising awareness, driving less, recycling these are some of the solutions in fighting climate change. Companies also contribute a lot on the release of carbon dioxide gasses for the world to be a better place there should be strikes that encourages people to stop supporting organizations that are not investing in green products, producing more environmentally friendly products. All individuals who will not be supporting the fight against climate change should be taxed more."
614280ed34d0c9737fb0f796,"Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a place's usual temperature for a month or season. Climate change is also a change in the Earth's climate.

These are various ways to fight climate change. Encourage people to walk or cycle to their destinations if possible, rather than driving, as that increases carbon emissions, resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer, which leads to climate change.

And of course, one can’t discuss climate change solutions without mentioning green technologies. Things like wind, solar, and geothermal energy are increasingly viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Although their production currently requires the expenditure of fossil fuels and other harmful industrial processes, these technologies are improving rapidly in the hopes of creating energy sources that require relatively minimal damage to the planet. 

Perhaps the biggest, and most obvious, solutions would be to end government subsidies to fossil fuel companies, funnelling this money instead into things like affordable housing within urban areas in order to reduce sprawl. 

The dangers presented by the climate emergency are real and can paint a gloomy picture of what the future holds for subsequent generations of people and all other inhabitants on earth. Already, undeniable effects are being felt throughout the world. Yet it isn’t too late to turn things around. Countries like the United States bear an outsized responsibility to curb emissions, being among the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. The incentive to create a viable future grows more each year."

6097e36e99d6c893daf55676,"Mankind, especially in recent decades, has caused a rapid increase in the average temperatures of the earth. Consequently, we must change our habits before it is too late and climate change is irreversible. This essay will contain some ideas on how to combat global warming. First of all, a very effective method of reducing pollution, which is the main cause of global warming, is to reduce waste. Unfortunately, many of the products that are purchased end up never being used, thus causing an unacceptable waste of resources and an increase in the amount of waste produced. Another very effective method is to increase and encourage separate waste collection. Properly disposing of products that we no longer use allows us to recover raw materials that would otherwise be wasted. Another idea to reduce global warming is to revolutionize transport by enhancing public transport, especially in large cities. This would make it possible to eliminate emissions produced by cars. By building more cycle paths, then, we could incentivize the movement by bike, in order to reduce the emissions produced by short journeys.
One last idea concerns the products we choose to buy. By choosing zero kilometer products we can reduce emissions caused by transport, and by purchasing products with a reduced environmental impact we can reduce our ecological footprint.
In conclusion, we still have time to be able to change our habits and, in this way, limit our emissions of harmful gases and the production of waste.
Only with everyone's commitment will we be able to lower average temperatures and reverse the trend of the rapid increase in recent years."
602d29200724e36ae7a9def2,"The contribution of every individual is necessary right now in order to reduce climate change and prevent the abusive use of natural resources. Besides human activities which are highly contributing to this damage to the ecosystem, we may find other factors that are contributing to climate change. 
Climate change can be prevented and our planet saved by many changes we can make in our lives style; these changes can be big (such as government action to fight climate change) or small (mainly based on individuals to create a big effect on a world scale). 
One of the most important actions that need to be taken when it comes to fighting climate change is to stop mass deforestation. Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will only worsen if more trees are cut down. Initiatives must be taken to encourage individuals to plant more trees in order to balance the deficit in trees that our planet has. By using plant species with the highest lifelong carbon fixation such as the live oak which is the most efficient carbon-capturing tree, our planet will be able the quickly close the deficit gap.
Individuals can on their side, upgrade all their ordinary bulbs to LED lights which use less energy. Using this LED technology will reduce the energy consumption of individuals by a significant amount on a global scale. To have a greener future our dependence on fossil fuels and electricity needs to be reduced right away, instead of increasing it with the electrical car which is definitely not a green solution as big companies are trying to convince us. 
In conclusion, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the planet by putting their personal interest aside for the good of the only one planet that holds life.

With that said every big change happens with the help of everyone, not only because of our own actions themselves, but also because our actions tend to influence those around us, making our efforts more valuable.
Now let's get into detail with what will help fight climate change, little things that we can all practice every day: 1- first of all it's important that we realize how big of an issue it is, we need more people to participate into the fight and spread the message, while we think it's already a global issue, many people around us don't actually know how to fight it and what it means.
2 - cutting back on the use of cars/ planes,trains and other gas based transportations.
3- driving a bike or walking as much as possible.
4- eating more vegetables and grain and less meat.
5- paying more attention.
6- recycling.

Although we are taught to recycle, use less water and travel via public transport; our efforts will not collectively be enough to squander the damage our planet has received. It is up to humanity to cancel the constant consumption culture which past generations have created in order to save the world from it's current path of destruction. Once we have collectively stopped our levels of consumption, production will seize and current amounts of resource mining will drop. Thus, leading to a better and less grim future. The damage we have caused is irreversible but we can still do better and stop making it worse. 

This is not an invitation, but a mere reality of the future we face. The best plan possible is for governments and the people to stop corporations from taking our planet for granted."

5eb64825c23fbf5300fb5bd9,"The main direction we need to take to fight climate change is through innovation, to make use of ideas that can reverse the effects of climate change or slow it down. All throughout history, from the ecological disaster on the Easter Islands to the Dust Bowl, brakes have not been the way humanity operates when there are incentives in the other direction. And we will never be able to create enough incentives to put the brakes on enough to stop still catastrophic effects of climate change.

As our other methods will never be enough, they should not be the focal point. Given this, what we need to foster is investment in research and development. This may be seen as an overly optimistic approach as we don’t even know what the solution is or if we can find one, but as this is a physical problem, there will always be numerous possibilities. And with a collective and concentrated effort towards a singular goal the process will be exponentially accelerated. 

So the problem that needs to be solved is how to shift the focus from austerity-like solutions towards a more progressive-optimistic solution to solve climate change. We will get nowhere with the path of existential dread and a slow shift of sustainability. The only solution is innovation and progress."

For example, never leave your appliances on standbay, remember to pull the plug from the socket when your smartphone is fully charged. Eat fewer or smaller portions of meat. Leave the car at home. Go to work by bike or by the public transport. Did you know that you can buy unique outfits in second hand? I love them!

As we all may know climate change is a result of global warming which is caused by many factors such as pollution and to some extent earths growing population. for many years we have focussed on reducing pollution such as running programmes that educate people and finding alternatives and this has surely slowed down climate change but has not stopped it.

I believe we need to start holding big corporations and countries accountable, however a simple fine was not be the answer. As to many big corporations this is just another business expense that could possible be deducted from their income in favour of lowering their tax.

We need to hold these companies accountable by applying more political pressure, we need to provide them with a greater incentive to participate in the fight against climate change and if they don't they should not be allowed to operate. it should be mandatory that this big corporations should have a committee that deals with how they could be contributing to climate change all year around and constantly adapts new protocols to lower it.

Secondly we can prohibit deforestation and cutting down trees. Lastly I believe that climate change is one of those issues that can mostly be fought through educating people and modeling behavior.

Today however, we won't talk about the problems, but about the solutions that we can bring to the table to help fight this great threat.

The first solution would be to attack one of the biggest problems, the pollution caused by the meat industry. For that, my proposition would be to create a new way to make meat, and we already have something like that. We have scientists that can recreate new cells from blood, and with that, we can eventually make whole products of meat with only the blood of the cow, that way we can avoid having so many farm animals making a lot of polution, and we will only have a few from which we'll draw blood to make new meat products.

This is the frame of mind we have to consider when we are trying to turn people’s minds and hearts towards this problem. We have to consider ourselves the heroes. We have to become the heroes because up to now, we have been the bad guys. 
Well? We have to think simultaneously big and small. BE SMALL. Buy less instead of cheaper - use longer instead of cooler - repair - walk - live with the idea that you’ve only borrowed this planet for a short amount of time. Borrowed it from those who will come after you. And if you’re big? A corporation, a government, an union? BE AN EXAMPLE. Incentivise sustainability. Reward change. Inspire by your own conscientiousness. Show that it CAN BE DONE. 
Consider every air mile. Build water bodies to keep the moisture in the land. Plant trees. Protect biodiversity. Explore sustainable agriculture. And most importantly - don't be afraid of nuclear power. It’s the only way to provide reliable, strong, and carbon neutral power in the long run. With the safety measures in place we have now, there is no need to fear another Chernobyl or Fukushima. We see countries and states who bent before the mindless activism and closed their own nuclear power plants - only to become dependent on warmongering regimes burning carbon dioxine producing gas and oil. Solar is not effective, and wind is too unpredictable. Nuclear energy is safe, clean, and requires very little accommodation.

Actionable change will likely need to be incentivized if we wish to change the already troubling course the planet is taking. Charging luxury taxes on larger vehicles, disposable goods such as highly packaged foods and fast fashion, implementing more bulk based ways of obtaining consumer goods by using genuinely reusable packaging, making public transit a truly viable option for all people by making all points of access friendly to those with mobility issues, and having well planned and extensive routes, frequent services at an affordable cost.

It also needs to tackle energy poverty, which can affect up to 28%. Irish households. Energy standards for new construction are also to be set.
