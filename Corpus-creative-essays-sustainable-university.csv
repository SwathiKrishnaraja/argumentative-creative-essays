Landscaping and biodiverse gardens should be implemented across the university to provide native wildlife habitats and give students a valuable opportunity to explore and learn about biodiversity on campus. groups should be established to maintain and expand the gardens frequently.
2. Food gardening projects. Many students dine on campus, and learning how to grow and prepare organic food in university gardens will both empower them to make healthier choices and give them valuable skills for our food-scarce future. Surpluses can also be handed over to soup kitchens and poverty alleviation schemes to make a difference.
3. Rainwater catchment. Students should team together to build rainwater catchment systems that reduce the university's reliance on municipal water sources. Rainwater can be used to water gardens, flush toilets, wash hands, and more. water-saving mechanisms should also be installed in sinks and toilets to reduce the campus's water demands.
4. Neighborhood cleanups. Students should team up to pick up refuse and litter around campus and nearby neighborhoods on a weekly basis. Rubbish should be tallied and weighed to encourage learning about plastic pollution and how it can be dimished through community efforts.
5. Carpooling rules. Students that travel to university should follow rules about how they travel to minimize CO2 emissions. for instance, those that can carpool must do so, and the university should also make electric buses or student transportation methods available."

College campuses are swimming in broken and outdated electronics. That’s why setting up an e-waste collection event is a great idea for promoting campus sustainability. 
Get permission from your facilities department to set up collection bins in an on-campus parking lot. Contact local recycling businesses and vendors to see what kinds of electronics they accept and make sure they are willing to accept bulk drop-offs. 
Check to see if there are any additional fees for recycling certain items. 
Reach out to your university and local businesses to sponsor the recycling drive.
Use social media to spread the word about your event and include a list of accepted electronics. 

-Set Up Recycling Stations Around Campus
The first step toward college campus sustainability is to make recycling as easy as possible. Every trash bin on campus is paired with a recycling bin for students to toss plastic bottles, paper, glass, cans and cardboard into without having to sort it all out beforehand. Using this system, the university hopes to achieve a 50 percent waste diversion rate. If your school doesn’t currently have a robust recycling or waste diversion scheme in place, you can:

Contact local recyclers and determine what types of materials you can drop off with them. 
Work with your school’s facilities department to find spare bins and make sure they are clearly labeled with accepted materials. 
Place the bins in highly trafficked parts of your campus. Designate a team of volunteers to collect the recyclables every week, making sure to weigh each bag so you can demonstrate how effective your program is. "

The first step toward college campus sustainability is to make recycling as easy as possible. A great example of this is Bowling Green State University’s single-stream recycling initiative. Every trash bin on campus is paired with a recycling bin for students to toss plastic bottles, paper, glass, cans and cardboard into without having to sort it all out beforehand. 

2. Plan an E-Waste Recycling Drive
College campuses are swimming in broken and outdated electronics. That’s why setting up an e-waste collection event is a great idea for promoting campus sustainability. 

3. Organize a Donation Program During Moving Season
When the time comes to move out of the dorms, college students have a lot of clutter to sort through. From extra food in the cupboards to the sweaters you didn’t wear all semester, your college can save these items from the landfill and send them to those in need. 

4. Start a Bike Rental Program
Biking to and from campus can have as little as one-seventh the impact as driving a car. Starting a bike share program can make it easier for students to ditch their cars for the semester. Approach your school’s administration to see if they will cover the cost of bikes, locks, racks and maintenance. 


5. Start a Campus Community Garden
Sometimes, creating a green campus means getting your hands dirty. At The University of Houston, students participate in a community garden where they grow organic produce and educate campus and community members about healthy living. All of their produce is donated to local food pantries to give low-income individuals access to fresh vegetables. "
60e0d0e810dc0d3c0eb7ea90,"Currently there are various educational institutions, civil society organizations and government agencies that have directed their participation and action in society within the framework of sustainable development. The concept of sustainability has permeated all aspects of science, politics and everyday life. Sustainable government and academic programs, projects and postgraduate courses in sustainable development, support programs for sustainable rural development, sustainable management of natural resources, etc. have been created; however, in many cases the concept is lost in a political and demagogic argument that does not get put into practice and is only reduced to some discourse to create a patronage relationship between the vulnerable social classes and the power elites, which are say the promoters of sustainable or sustainable development and progress in our country. The notion of sustainable development is an evolution of the old concept of development, since it contemplates economic and material progress, but in balance with social welfare through the responsible use of natural resources. In this way, it reconciles the three fundamental axes of sustainability: economic, ecological and social.

The implementation of a sustainable development program depends largely on the will of governments to formulate public policies that favor the awareness and participation of citizens and companies on issues such as reducing pollution, saving energy resources, using renewable energies.

In short, sustainable or sustainable development is a concept developed towards the end of the 20th century as an alternative to the usual development concept, emphasizing the reconciliation between economic well-being, natural resources and society, avoiding compromising the possibility of life in the planet, nor the quality of life of the human species. The Report on the State of Volunteering in the World highlights that, in most societies in the world, volunteers contribute significantly to economic and social development.5 Currently, there is widespread concern about the phenomenon of climate change , with the care of the environment and the conservation of material and immaterial assets of historical and cultural interest, so that the new generations can continue a planet Earth with a future.

5f67738a1aadce071e716263,"Stop using disposable items. One of the biggest sources of waste are disposable items such as plastic forks, knives, spoons, cups, water bottles, and everything else which gets used once and then tossed in the trash. Usually things made of paper are biodegradable, but most disposables composed of plastic aren’t. That means they can sit in landfills for hundreds of years before breaking down.

It can be tempting to save yourself the chore of having to wash dishes. But by sticking to permanent reusable plates, cutlery and cups, you’ll be living much more sustainably – and also save money in the long term.

You can also buy yourself a nice reusable water bottle, instead of buying water every time you go out. Some universities have even banned the sale of bottled water on campus, to encourage everyone to contribute to a more sustainable campus."

No need to, that is often the reality of everyday life and all you have to do is look around you. So we decided that our university will not stand by and take action. It is with great pleasure that I am pleased to announce that every student and lecturer can move around the university campus on bicycles, which are completely free of charge. Bikes can be left anywhere on campus. Another step towards change was the replacement of halogen bulbs in all areas and rooms of the university. The water we water our flowers with is rainwater. Similarly, we have been able to use rainwater for flushing. The heating temperature of the entire unvirezita is reduced by 1 degree Celsius, so prepare an extra layer of clothing if necessary. Information posters regarding tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint will be placed on recycled paper in all corridors. Please read them and try to follow the tips. There are a number of reasons for these measures and it is not just pressure from politicians. We have taken the fate of our planet into our own hands and we are proud of it. After all, it is not just about the future, but also about the present."
60b6868793cf7b832392a38b,"To implement sustainable ideas within a university can be quite challenging. The goal is to understand that the measurements implemented should be consolidated and further developed. 
Within an university campus, one simple and highly sustainable idea is the prohibition of fueled means of transportation. That is, within the campus, students and professors are only allowed to use micro.mobility sustainable solutions reducing the emissions relevantly. This solution has already been implemented in several cities and universities, with bicycles and other micro-mobility sustainable solutions being available within the campus for people to move around faster but sustainably. 
Furthermore, another preoccupation within the universities is food waste. One possibility would be to have the people serve themselves. It has been shown that when people serve themselves they estimate more adequately the amount of food they will intake, reducing significantly food waste."
5ede17df5600b50241a7443d,"A university for sustainability development would, of course be one that is able to maintain itself without any external help and would be very beneficial because it would let us maintain it at a low cost by only having workers on it while not needing to buy new raw materials.
Some ways to make a self sustaining university would be to use electricity gathered from the sun's light to mantain the electric apliances and to ensure electricity on cloudy days installing a couple of generators may be a good idea.
To ensure we are able of feeding our students on the university, we would need to save a big ammount of space for cultivating food and keeping animals so that they may be harvested and used in the school menu, although a different way to go about this would be to partner with a nearby farm to give us all the food we may need to feed them."

secondly lets tackle the food. avoiding unecessary plastic packaging for snacks, reducing the meat and animal product in the canteens, catering for specific needs. 
but how could we do all of this and still mantain an affordable fees? the state needs to start organizing itself in a better way. the government needs to start acting and repairing the damage that has done. 
a sustainable university needs to have a board of people concerned about the enviorment, and not only concerned but convinced to make the world a more sustainable place. "
6038e63a1713653046ef7482,"In my opinion, a balanced university is one for the construction of which thoughtful ideas have been used. Each building should be surrounded by a large amount of snooz and greenery. Flower meadows should be planted, which will allow the wasps to live.  Buildings should be built using the latest technologies, they should be self-sufficient, equipped with heat pumps and photovoltaic panels.Movement around such a university should take place only on foot or by bicycle. There should be a ban on moving a car, except for electric self-propelled cars. On the territory of the university should be st Water from the bathrooms should be sctajce for charging electric vehicles, charged with photovoltaic panels. Water from bathrooms should be used for watering plants outside. Students should be required to engage in various environmental rescue actions. Planting trees, shrubs. Actions should be organized to rebuild city centers, eliminate concrete and replace concrete with trees, grass and flowers. The university should be a green place, friendly to people and animals. Animal feeders, drinkers should be spaced.There should be no fountains, water is lost unnecessarily through them. A large amount of greenery is enough to protect people from the heat. Students should take care of the environment themselves, limit plastic packaging, do not waste food, do not clapp a lot of clothes and shoes. Organize collections of unnecessary things, fairs where you exchange your belongings with other people"
6137aaf89c3f9544d0232079,"Sustainability of an environment is key factor. To ensure that a place is around for a long term then it needs to be sustainable and that it can withhold challenges and it functions. A sustainable university needs to have and hold social and environmental challenges. Social challenges for a sustainable university include the people around the university and what it offers for the, the university must be open and compatible to everyone from different backgrounds of life and not deprive others from enjoying the university at large as this is one common place for people of different life with different societal background, if a a university is to be a sustainable university then it must accomodate everyone with everything it has for it to have a long standing place in the society. To be a sustainable university it is important to ensure that all environmental challenges faced are dealt with and there is no shortcoming of environmental solutions. An environment is very import to ensure that a university keeps its main priority and should there be negative environmental challenges then the university will not be a sustainable university and will not be able to serve and  carry out its priority as there lack of resources will hinder it from becoming a sustainable university for a long time as promised. It is essential that a university must have all resources to fight both societal and environmental challenges as these are key challenges that will tamper it from being a sustainable university. "
6108033c1bf591fee2013a07,"There are a lot of ways to make a university sustainable. For example, students can use reusable items and minimize the amount of disposable items they use. Disposable items are usually used once and tossed into a garbage can where they‘re taken and dumped into a landfill somewhere. This isn‘t helpful to the environment, especially since much of it isn’t biodegradable. 

The university could also make more sustainable choices, like using clean energy to power things. Another way they could do this is by turning lights off when they‘re not needed or replacing them with energy-saving lights. If a university has a recycling program and uses the money it makes from the recycling bin to help pay for things, like software and other resources, it could also drive costs down. A win-win for the sustainability and university finances!

Students can also look at buying second-hand things (from other students or faculty members) and reselling them to other people (on or off-campus).

Finally, students can pledge to limit their food waste and their other waste. A number of universities have a lot of ways to make this sustainable. There are a few examples that some universities use that you would need to research more. For example, some use geothermal heating, which is considered resource-efficient.

Students should also go digital for their school work and get rid of paper books. This limits the amount of paper used and saves backpack space too! University students can also recycle their paper materials in designated paper recycling bins on campus."
6111b8bc982e6972a924ee7c,I would advise that we plant more green trees around the campus and that we use materials that last long and not just cheap materials. We have to build tall building that do not consume a lot of space. There should be a lot of parking spaces for the students and staff members to be accommodated. A lot of recyclable bins should be implemented around the campus so students can dispose of their litter and not just throw it everywhere. There should be a lot of water reservoirs so that it looks like a natural setting and the windows of the buildings should be plastic  and not made out of glass. The campus roads should be made out of concrete so that they last longer and stronger. The material used to build the classes should be of high quality so that it will be able to stand and last for years and for other generations to come to be able to utilize it.
5bed50471f9cac0001734381,"Sustainability is a very important deal when it comes to universities, since it affects the students and consequently, their education, their interests and their future career. A lot of resources are mismanaged at the universities and big amounts of money go down the drain for insignificant tasks or ceremonies. Students in countries which do not have free education are required to pay tuitions and the university must allocate them fruitfully. First of all, my personal opinion is that books, which cost a lot of money and many times are not even useful, should have a remake on their way of using. Some books can go to the library and students could use them from there, instead of paying to get them. Also, digitalization should be obligatory in most universities. A whole lot of rooms are used just for storing paper, while they could be used differently (such as labs, student rooms, professor offices). In this way, more space can be acquired for academic purposes and less paper would be consumed, using less stationary resources, while the already printed paper can be recycled. Additionally, since students now are more accustomed to use technology, I believe that a very strong investment would be in technology. Although expensive, technology is a long-term improvement option for every task, from plain administrative to academic issues. Finally, from my point of view, a big part of the course guide for many departments is theoretical. More laboratories and internships under supervision should be implemented. This would save a lot of working hours for the academic staff, but also would give the students the chance to have a more hands-on experience on their field of study.  "
600a9ab59e9b701db49fbec1,"Create lots of parks and green areas on campus, ban cars inside the university grounds and prioritize bicycles (crair bike lanes) for bicycles, scooters, etc. Create parks with plenty of vegetation and shade that would benefit university students and faculty through contact with nature, create a botanical garden.
In the construction of buildings, plan well its architecture, materials used in construction and plan well the arrangement of buildings. For example, try to bring the buildings closer to each other or by areas (engineering area, health area, science area, etc).
On the roof of the buildings, put solar panels to use this unused area, energy that would later be fed to the lighting poles and use the energy of the buildings to reduce the energy footprint of the buildings. Irrigating green spaces only at night, and reusing used water from this irrigation, for example water from treatment plants.
In the university canteen, create a vegetarian option daily and change the meat and fish option between days, and you would have to buy the ticket on previous days to combat food waste."

Donating leftover food is also a great idea for reducing waste. Another idea would be starting a bike rental program.

60c1da4f43673b0d9446078e,"Universities are not only places you are eductaed about your major but also should educate about life, sometimes even in really unconsious ways. So building that kind of place with a lot of different ways to help the planet can open eyes of students, and maybe help them understand ho to behave properly. Firsltly we should think about what materials we going to use while building it: are windows going to be big enough to heat the place, and if they are going to be tight enough not to make place cold? How place is going to be heated? Take to consideration what type of green sources of heating would be the most sustainable in that area, is it windy so we could use windmills or maybe solar pannels to produce the energy? Maybe we should also think about what kind of furinture will be inside: is it going to be bought from second-hand or maybe bought from local small buissnes, or maybe encourage the citizens to help make new from second-hand scratches? The outside of the campus is really importatnt too. We shouldn't make it all from concrete, but make this place as approachable as we can. Green area would be really great not only for planet but also for student. Planting trees and flowers is not only pretty but also good for environemt. Lasltly I would make recycling bins and have posters about how properly recycle things."

611da2edb4dd06832bb888b1,Sustainable University is a university that is not dependent on one factor but multiple to be self sustaining in any environment it may be in. To achieve this it has to be able to nourish vegetation and maintain even in drought seasons. Must be able to provide energy in multiple ways. Be able to convert energy for usage on different scenarios. Must be built on passive design. Allowing orientation to accommodate natural lighting to warm up the rooms. Streams of water must be sufficient. It shouldn't lack in anything that is required for the livelihood of man kind.  That's a sustainable university. Another aspect of sustainability is to know the priorities to planning and being able to provide energy consistent versus the downside of such implementation. Downside being that the idea is not well understood hence insufficient utilization of this technology .

There needs to large scale energy consumption of electricity in these areas, so it cant be reliant on fossil fuels. Where Universities need to improve is through the constant travel to far-off places for conferences and lectures. That concept needs to be re-imagined to ensure more carbon neutrality perhaps via a shared, virtual meeting mechanism whereby academics are able to interact both formally in presentations and more informally where there is a great deal of valuable knowledge sharing accumulated outside of formal avenues. The University should make use of a large parking area for employees and students who use vehicles, that should be shaded by solar panels. Once their cars are parked, the rest of the campus should be a vehicle free zone and pedestrianisation be mandatory. "

I think that we should be more concerned about the environment because we cant live without it and it looks like no one cares. We should support this changes and help them do something about it or we will lose all of this beautiful and green planet. That is why everyone should do something.

The most sustainable universities are actually NO universities. Online education is more popular than ever and does not require any buildings or energy, just the student's own computer and WiFi. Therefore, any university buildings should be kept to an absolute minimum.
When there are buildings, they should be powered by renewable energy and designed to use the least power possible. Rooms should be designed to stay cool in summer and warm in winter. Ideally, the terms would be structured around the most comfortable times to study as well.
Sustainable development also means the university should exist in symbiosis with its students and its surroundings. It should be intelligently designed so students can access it easily and it doesn't impede other citizens. This might mean providing a public transport system that quickly moves students from location to location.
Most of all, the university should be built to last and to withstand the changing weather conditions. "
61140ecd6c72bb8ce54d0ac8,"Universities are melting pots of ideas and hence usually have various kinds of buildings which usually make the whole complex vast. I would design convertible buildings that adapt the the requirements as per demand. The convertible buildings will have to be interconnected  so as to limit the distance covered by students as they walk from 1 block to the other on campus.
I would also introduce buildings that resemble tree houses that are built into the existing environment rather than clearing a site and introducing new flora and fauna. This will ensure a harmonious interplay between nature man made environments. This will create an environment that mimics a real forest which has less environmental effects.
Transportation is always critical hence I would invent a bicycle that can carry more than 5 students. This will ensure a transportation alternative free of fuel in and around campus and ensure a healthier student population. A shuttle bus made of plant based fibers entirely that runs on a water engine to mass transport students would also be introduced which will have no CO2 production.
I would also invent road and path ways made of earth as opposed to tar and concrete as this will lessen the CO2 production.
A system where rain water is the only water received and is managed in a way that it is adequate to run the university would be critical as a sustainable intervention.

A sustainable university would only succeed with acknowledgement of the situation and how students and even staff can be an efficient part in the solution. They have to make sustainability central to all their actions. Everything always rotates around the same point: people. The societal challenges that many of us face when introducing or suggesting any environmental benefit is always a set back. But we have to fight, and this fight starts from educating people about the environment, climate and how sustainability is not only for the environment but for our lives because everything is linked to each other. 
Having a sustainable university which properly addresses situations is a step forward in saving the planet and making the people more aware of everything.

So it's expected that, if we want to change our environment, we should understand and explain so that others can understand, the goals, priorities, consequences and changes that will require to make a sustainable university, and how that will impact each and every student. Little things like teaching every student to recycle and get used to doing so by setting recycling stations around the campus. Or maybe even start a bike renting at the campus! Giving summits about sustainability and it's impact on the planet, making sure everyone learns what they can do. Encourage every single of them to do a sustainability fair and even implement a college vegetable garden, where every student can take care of the vegetables, that can be used to being consumed later in the cafeteria. Even adopting sustainability goals, to make sure everyone gets encouraged to do their part, like it was a video game!
Sometimes it's all about inspiring and informing your community, in a way they will want to do better and they will know how to do better. Challenging them to learn and progress and inspires others, because people can influenciate each other.

-        Easy to clean, non-wearing and durable floor finishes to cater for large amounts of human traffic
-        East facing to take advantage of natural light
-        Heat conservation techniques for buildings

5db9870052e7df000a11af99,"To be sustainable, one follows the idea of reduce, reuse, recycle, with the first being highest priority, then decending to lowest priority. The effect this has on sustainable development in universities revolves primarily around the construction of the relevant building, the running of those building, and then the life-styles of the people using those buildings.

To be 'reducing' in the construction process involvese minimalism. Not necessarily in an aesthetic sense, but a mathematical, engineering perspective. This doesn't entail boring designs though, as sophistaced aerodynamics can be embedded into a buildings structure to promote naturally occuring temperature regulation using the wind, or capturing sunlight and convecting that heat through the building. Green rooftops can promote better insulation in both warmer and colder temperatures if done effectively. Combined, this kind of thinking results in reducing the overall resource input into the making and living-in of the buildings made.

Reusing a building may sound counter intuitive, since buildings are often static, but in certain settings, creating modular buildings can be done to promote a setting where, as buildings become more in-use or out-of-use, the total space each building has can change. If a of the university finds itself under-utilised, a modular section could be removed and put instead in a busier location. Of course, desiging something as solid as a building to also be easier to dissamble makes for difficult structural designs in terms of longevity. If people can take it apart easily, maybe nature will too, which is bad.

Lastly, how the building are lived in. This ties in with the minimalist ideas mentioned earlier. If as much of the process of being in the building relies on abunduant renewable sources like sunlight and wind (either as means of generating electricity or simply as passive temperature control) then you promote a holistic environment continually in-touch with nature, while still benefting from the convenient results of human enginuity where we aren't baking and freezing every day."

It is important that we meet our needs but at the same time we should not compromise the needs of the future generations. As a university let us use water sustainably by ensuring that we close all taps securely if not in use. we can also recycle the water that we are using for bathing and washing so that we can also use it for gardening instead of letting it just be lost. Instead of using electricity when studying why not buy our own solar lights ,installs solar panels in the university so tht we use a cleaner and cheaper form of energy which is readily available. All the plastic materials that we are using, we can rather reuse them that putting them in landfills, this will ensure that we reduce the waste on our soils. also instead of importing we can use locally produced products and materials made from recycled material. Let us all leaen to reuse what we have, recycle what we can and use the rather clean gases all the times."

I mean, if we can teach people good habits in their youngest ages, then we have much bigger chance to give them long and healthy life. So I would go step further with this idea and make not only universities sustainable, but also elementary schools and middle schools (at least to some extend). As for actual ideas how to implement anything, we must start with government. They must enforce what's needed first, we can't leave this to universities themselves, because it won't work. It won't be cheap and it will immediately give no chance for poorer regions. Similarly like in climate change problem, we must use solar panels and wind energy as main sources in our university. "
60f942b4b42053a9b2e657b5,"A sustainable university should ensure that all the students are law-abiding. How so? There should be rules and laws that are put in place to ensure that they follow them. For example, littering should be regarded as breaking the law or the rules and there should be a penalty for that. The university should also adopt a paperless strategy in order to avoid littering and wasting natural resources. Since the university uses a lot of electricity, some parts of it should use solar panels in order to reduce the bills and to the natural resources that are being used. The university should also use drones for delivery of textbooks are anything that is made out of paper in order to save the roads so that trucks or any delivery vehicle will not damage the road."

I have a few ideas that I think it could be used in a lot of universities such as: impose, in all areas of the campuses, drinking fountains for students, teachers and staff to fill their water bottles. This water could be re-used, in other words, it would suffer a lot of chemical changes through a system imposed inside the campus (appropriating campuses fields instead of creating new ones near the campus), for it to be clean and ready to personal use, after being used for sanitary or pool purposes. In this way, the university wouldn't need to waste any more money on resources nor waste any water in it's day-to-day activities."

Let students use all their various skills with regards to architecture, engineering, land surveying, building, painting, plumbing - let it be a life skills university with more than the usual types of courses held at a regular university. so let the students who are learning to be an engineer, work with a qualified engineer. This gives work experience and real time learning. Let students learn trades at the university. Let it be part of a trade that also learns about the environment and how to paint or plumb or build etc with sustainability in mind. Solar power, wind power - let all the factors for sustainability come into how the university is built and let it be completely off the grid but able to use the grid if need be. It requires a lot of input and work and planning. Forestry as well. Soil sustainability and regenerative farming education. There can be an area for farming and teaching long term benefits of farming sustainably. Let the building itself be built in such a way that it can be built around the flora. Let there be a veterinary section. It is such a difficult course to get into. Let it increase in size to accommodate more students. Help with sterilising animals to stop roaming animals and educate people. Have a section of the University to educate people on all areas of life - re-using water, simple things like litter in the right bins for recycling, a recycling depot, the building itself where possible to made from recycled products, plots of land for farming with students staying in a res helping to work the land.

A sustainable university must associate the operational aspects of teaching, research and institutional management, with the education of students, teachers and employees for sustainability so that the university community can know and practice a lifestyle that promotes quality. of life and well-being both for the present and for the future. To make universities more sustainable, a regime must be applied to transfer all documents to digital programs aimed at their security, obsolete devices that have a lot of energy costs and few/no alternatives to change them must be replaced. Lights and sockets should be turned off when no one is using them. This aspect seems small, but it is of great importance to reduce energy costs. The university community must be taught and prepared for all aspects related to the subject. Lectures should be given and workshops should be held to improve people's adherence."

Moreover, lots of greenery should be planted throughout the campus, also inside the buildings as well.

Lots of glass shall be used throughout, to ensure that less lighting and energy is required. Where lights are needed, these can be set up for sensors, to ensure that when no one is in a building no light or energy will be used.

Only electric cars shall be allowed to drive through campus, in addition most areas will be pedestrianised. Also, lots of bike lanes and scooter lanes will be installed to incentivise people not to travel by car or bus.

Lots of different bins will be located throughout campus, ensuring it is easy for everyone to recycle everything accordingly. 

Schemes will also be run throughout campus, focussing on walking, recycling and beening ""green"", students and teachers will be rewarded with prizes for those who win the schemes and competitions.

All building will be built using sustainable building practices, such as wood etc, minimal concrete shall be used.

There is no reason not to educate young people about sustainability, and one of the first steps is to foster a sustainable university.The answer, as you probably have realized, is very complicated. But there are some simple things students can do to help the environment right on campus. For example, you can start by taking shorter showers and putting off buying that new device - like a generator. Additionally, you can try to think outside the box when going to class. By developing a sustainable mindset, the effect only grows with time. University must look toward sustainability because we need to change some of the things happening in there. One thing we could do is to have more greenery on the campus grounds, instead of concrete walkways and asphalt parking lots. We could also work with organizations to help change what they are doing. Universities can invest in companies that are more sustainable and make the world a better place."

First of all we should improve our green areas, set up recycling stations around campus and other structures, improve bike rental programs on different university locations to reduce emissions, and reduce the amount of food waste also by improving composting programs and overall decreasing our dangerous habits. University building too should be built by having renewable energy in mind, solar panels should become way more commons everywhere and here too. Eventually make some interesting summits where students and people working in Universities can speak and gather ideas about how to make a change and teach each others about it."

Also,students could potentially begin developing themselves eco friendly behaviours and actions such as recycling,new and more efficient techniques of saving energy and peaceful protests to inform and present to the rest of the society the necessity of sustainability. Moreover, inside the university campuses we could have forests or gardens that they could be used for a cleaner air environment and as a place where students could come in close contact with nature.

Universities can be considered as ‘small cities’ because of their huge population, size and happenings in campus, which could cause serious direct and indirect effects to the environment. In recent years, sustainability has burst into the higher education scene and universities play a major part in addressing environmental problems because their education, research and general participation can create long-term outcomes.
Many universities in the world put serious efforts to create sustainable campuses. Sustainability is being integrated into higher education institutions’ mission and planning, curricula, research, student life, operations and purchasing, and community partnerships. In this paper, with regard to the above mentioned issues, the importance of creating sustainable campuses is explained. Moving from different sustainable campus organizations and networks in the World; indicators for sustainability are analyzed, and suggestions are made to encourage creating sustainable campuses in higher education.
Universities that are members of PRME aspire to develop a range of students competencies, grouped in six key areas (PRME 2018): - Social skills: teamwork, team building, communication skills, presentation; - Business in the real world: stakeholder management, engagement of community needs through business, marketing, sustainability enhancement, entrepreneurship, project management; - Personal skills: critical thinking, self-awareness, decision making, leadership, creativity, problem solving; - Intercultural skills; - Academic research, business models, planning and coordination; and - Service, volunteering, empathy, social responsibility, global mindset, ethical awareness, empathy

5f2e4f6e9832d71ae6cdc4ab,"A sustainable university is also an eco-sustainable university. A microcosm developed vertically, with roofs covered in solar panels, green spaces with rainwater collection to be reused for plant sustenance, and the necessary parking spaces to be moved underground. The university's energy subsistence could be complemented by the presence of community gardens and the mandatory self-management of common spaces. Regarding the micro-management of university resources, disposable plastic in the cafeteria should also be replaced by bamboo. Given the future of electric cars, recharging totems inside the car park would also be useful to incentivise the use of sustainable energy. Any excess energy produced could be resold outside, so as to not only lower the university's costs, but also turn it into a profit. To discourage the use of polluting vehicles, bicycles and mopeds could also be given on loan for use upon payment of a security deposit, to be returned at the end of the academic year. Although these may seem like small actions, it is the whole that reduces the impact locally, and the possibility of being taken as an example by other universities gives prestige to ours, as well as being environmentally positive."
61204d608c6f4bfc40b83d49,"The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and contributes to global warming. Time to get rid of this ancient energy source, and use energy more efficiently:
Install solar cells on the university’s rooftops
Optimise the ventilation, air-conditioning and heating of building management systems
Reduce the brightness of computer screens
Install automatic movement sensors to switch off lights in buildings
Turn PCs off or into stand-by mode when idle

Gardening, landscape and biodiversity
-Time to get outdoors, enjoy some fresh air, and create something practical with your hands:
-Build a campus garden with herbs and an insect hotel
-Maintain a flower meadow
-Introduce non-toxic cleaning products
-Engage students and staff to plant a tiny forest close to the university
-Construct green roofs and rooftop gardens to literally have a green university

Clean water
Water is a beautiful resource that gives birth to life on this planet. What a shame to waste it!
-Store rainwater from rooftops in tanks
-Install water saving devices in toilets and tabs
-Replace bottled water coolers with tap water coolers
-A good sustainability project idea is to use rainwater to flush toilets
-Install water refill stations

Recycling-related sustainability project ideas
Our current economic model takes natural resources as inputs and creates waste as outputs. A circular economy aims to eliminate the idea of waste. Here is how you can help to promote recycling at your university:
-Set-up recycling stations for mobile phones, pens, markers and highlighters throughout the campus
-Introduce double-sided printing to reduce paper waste
-Implement an e-waste policy to properly recycle electronic waste
-Donate old but still functioning electronic devices to charity
-Promote the purchase of second hand furniture for university offices"
60fd5289743d08eb44f96718,"A sustainable university includes these key elements of sustainability which are environmental protection, economic performance and social cohesion.

So what is meant by environmental protection is that a university should perform its duties while ensuring that the environment is well taken care of, meaning they should not engage in activities that might affect the environment they operate within. This includes ensuring that all the dumping, disposal of chemicals etc, is done in accordance with the necessary regulations and protocols.

The meaning of economic performance is simply to ensure that the University contribute to the economy of the country it operates in. This includes taxes payed to the government of the country which help the people of the country by ensuring health care is affordable and that people can be helped out should they not be able to afford certain things.

Lastly social cohesion simply means that the University understands that we are from different backgrounds, hence respect for all is needed and expected from the University that no individual needs to feel excluded or discriminated upon but they should create an inclusive environment for all "
58c62eac444ade00010231a9,"I believe that a university structure can be sustainable thanks to a complex set of means and measures aimed at minimizing the waste of resources.
Often, the university campuses are located in peripheral areas with a large outdoor area and this surface could be occupied by large structures of solar panels (even better if they are elevated, so as to provide shade for the people below).
These panels could also be aesthetically pleasing, thanks to the new materials used.
Many activities could be carried out remotely with great fuel savings and furthermore it should be expected that all the internal structures of the university have an eye towards sustainability: for example, the canteen should be completely ecological, therefore there should be nothing that cannot be recycled and the same foods should take into account the ecological footprint necessary for their creation.
Transportation to the university should all be powered by green energy and there should be incentives for students to reach the university (where possible) by environmentally friendly means, such as bicycles.
University buildings should also be insulated to minimize heat loss and the need for winter heating"
616ae0ba87f70a4f02edd172,"I think sustainable universities are a good idea.
In fact, the likelihood is high that university campuses end up producing far more waste than other types of residence, simply because of the high population they are catering to. After all, in some areas the population can jump tens of thousands when university term begins.
One of the biggest sources of waste are disposable items such as plastic forks, knives, spoons, cups, water bottles, and everything else which gets used once and then tossed in the trash. Usually things made of paper are biodegradable, but most disposables composed of plastic aren’t. That means they can sit in landfills for hundreds of years before breaking down.

It can be tempting to save yourself the chore of having to wash dishes. But by sticking to permanent reusable plates, cutlery and cups, you’ll be living much more sustainably – and also save money in the long term.

You can also buy yourself a nice reusable water bottle, instead of buying water every time you go out. Some universities have even banned the sale of bottled water on campus, to encourage everyone to contribute to a more sustainable campus."
611e58f3b7cfe10fe9eef3df,"The environment may not be the first thing that most students consider. However, wherever there are people, local ecosystems are impacted. This is also true on college and university campuses.

In fact, because of the large population that university campuses serve, it is likely that they generate far more waste than other types of residence. After all, when the school year begins, the population in some areas can increase by tens of thousands!

Ideas for a Sustainable university:
Stop using Disposable items- Disposable items such as plastic forks, knives, spoons, cups, water bottles, and anything else that is used once and then discarded are major sources of waste. Instead of using disposable items we should opt for biodegradable items or Recyclable items.

Buy local items- buying locally helps improve the regional economy and reduces carbon footprint than shipping items from away towns or cities.

Get Cycling- Driving a car, plain and simple, causes pollution. Riding a bicycle is one of the most environmentally friendly modes of local transportation available because the only energy it consumes is that which your legs expend. It will also help you stay fit and healthy!"
60eccd4d9b4a0c1f4ab919a4,My idea of a sustainable university is one that encourages an eco-friendly envirionment and teaches its students on how to be sustainable. A university that encourages planting of trees all around its premises and encourages both stuff and students to plant their own vegetable gardens to produce their own food and also help the environment while doing so. Also teaching them how to sustain these gardens and plants. A unibversity that will also encourage and do continueous  research about how we can sustain not just the university but the planet as a whole. A university that will hold conferences that will be accessible worldwide teaching other people outside the university about sustainability. A university that will challange the act of deforestation and spread awareness about the dangers it poses to our planet in the future. A university that encourages the creation of  inventions that are eco-friendly and safe for the environment. A university that encourages responsible usage of our already strained resources such as water.

The Institutions must provide a good environment to facilitate this.

There should be modern Equipment's and Technologies to enable ease in learning and to assist the Lecturers to pass the knowledge to students effectively.

There should be fairness in the way everyone is treated within the University without any discrimination in terms of racial, gender or Religion.

The Courses offered should be relevant to our current global requirements able to mitigate the challenges facing the world today.

The education fees should be affordable and the disadvantaged students from poor backgrounds should be assisted either with bursaries or Financial loans. This will enable every qualifying student pursue their education and their dreams regardless of their backgrounds. "
5e2df2855e01ef3e5d01ab58,"I believe that our university should work towards the global goals stated by the UN, the major ones being to eradicate extreme poverty, reduce inequalities, promote peace and justice, and solve the climate crisis.

Obviously, our university isn’t going to change the world on its own, but we should do our part and make sure that our university is aligned with the goals stated by the UN.

To start with, we should make sure that students here that have a poor monetary background get the support and funding they need to continue their studies. By scholarships or outside funding, all students here should afford a roof over their heads, food on their tables and money to purchase literature and other amenities that a student needs to succeed.

We have to make sure that all students are treated with respect and are provided the same opportunities to succeed no matter their race, sexual orientation or gender. To work towards this goal we should have a student council that any students can bring their concerns to if they feel they have been treated unjustly. The council can then try to solve the issue or send it up to higher channels such as the school administration if they feel it’s warranted. 

We should also make sure to do our part fighting climate change. We should take care of our green areas and parks, have plenty of bins where students can throw their trash rather than littering, and make sure we provide classes educating our students of the importance of taking care of our planet."

University campuses and student groups have recently focused on becoming more ecologically friendly. From reduced paper and plastic usage to greater reuse and recycling activities, it is apparent that the younger generation is passionate about sustainability.

Waterlogic offers five suggestions for making your campus environment friendlier. Finally, to greatly reduce your carbon impact, consider using a water dispenser to refill a reusable water bottle.

A 1.5 degree Celsius global warming study demonstrates that human activities are influencing the climate all around the world. Glacial melt is causing sea levels to rise to unprecedented levels, putting coastal communities at peril. Freshwater supplies are running low, posing a threat to cities around the world, while carbon dioxide levels are higher than they have been in the last 800,000 years.

Campus-wide efforts are an important aspect of making colleges more sustainable. Individuals can, however, make a difference if they know what to do — here are five methods to make your campus more eco-friendly:
1.  Reduce printing by reading on-screen
2.  Refuse, reduce, reuse or recycle
3. Help promote ground-breaking initiatives
4. Be smarter with your water usage
5. Stop buying bottled water"
60d1ad57fb10e23b2157d23a,"The university should be carbon free. No cars, students have place to live inside and a circular rail train covers the long distance travel, and inside the campus bicycles are available.

Teachers coming from outside are not allowed to travel often, so either stay in the campus or provide classes remotely with once a month physical gathering. 

Vegetables and meat are produced localy. Rain water is stored, solar is the main source of energy. What can not be produced locally is used in a very reduced amount in comparison with what is locally possible.
Students can pay their scholarship by working in the campus community, the university should include all kinds of areas as possible, for exemple agriculture and science, medecin. Covering all aspects of modern life would avoid the need to use external services , often travelling etc.

Plastic use is banned,or limited to very restrictive cases. 

Clothing should be acessible but passing choosen according to a set of defined criterias to avoid producing waste, so they should produced to last longe rand could be exchanged in a second hand store, also produced with natural materials.

An App/Database monitors and stores a student/professional ecologic footprint, for example every minutes in the shower have a certain value, eating a beaf also, etc so each one as a limited budget independent of the money each one has. Every consumed product would be priced in carbon footprint rather than in Money. Also this carbon footprint price tag could include some level of scarcity leverage.

6121fe1cc71dd4a7dad85d5e,"Firstly I think that our university needs  to start the transition to clean and  green energy. We need to make use of solar and wind energy. God has blessed us with these resources so we need to make use of it, which I turn will help our planet. 
We need to get the students onto a rewards program where they can earn points for being more sustainable. They could use their points for free lunches at the cafeteria once they have earned enough points. 
The university needs to be revamped to become more sustainable. The entire university will need to be properly insulated so there won't be a need to use electricity to heat or cool the university.
We need the students to become more proactive in recycling and planting of vegetation etc
Transport in the university grounds must be limited in a way eg. Staff and students that have fuel driven vehicles need to park their vehicles at a selected area and use bicycles, walk or electric vehicles around campus.
When it comes to meals prepared on campus by th university, we need to make them healthier, maybe even grow our own vegetables and herbs. Also make sure we that the products that they use is eco-friendly and all packaging is able to be recycled.
We need to put in  alot more effort to  reduce any kind of wastage eg. we must make sure we don't have leaking taps to end water wastage.
We also need to get holding tanks for all our rain water. We can reuse this water on campus for the gardens as well as sports fields.
Another way of getting the message across would be to have a competition  between all the universities in the country. The criteria for the competition would be to have the most sustainable university. The winner will get a a cash prize. We just need to motivate people to do more"
6030119a4403b3e1f92a756a,"They say - we are the future. And we are. So what could we do to make the future better? Is there any way to do that, espiecially on our university? The simple answer is - yes, of course. 
My first idea is installing as many solar panels as we can afford, because by generating our own renewable electricity in a long run we could, for example, drastically cut the electricity bills and we could earn money selling back excess power to the grid. And that's not the only thing - as we are the ones that shape the minds of this one and the future generations we should think about the carbon footprint we could reduce if only we used more renewable energy sources.
And what about making an impact more fun for students? Let's organize an annual event when all students collectively plant trees together. Make it a competition to give them more motivation - there would be prizes for the ones that would plant the biggest number of trees in one day. Maybe bonus points for scholarship? Or mentorship when it comes to their creative school projects? I think there are many options to consider. 
There is another thing we could do to help our students and it is - create on-campus garden with vegetables. You would ask - how is that going to help them? By making the healthy food more affordable to those in need. And once again, voluntary work on the garden maintance would be rewarded by points."

These can be cases and points of departure when looking into developing a sustainable university. Some of the ways of doing this could be by using renewable energy, by recycling, and by moving from print to digital.

In using renewable energy, solar energy could be used to power both the university and its residences. Students and staff could also be encouraged to join in to use solar powered items and opt to use solar power options as opposed to using grid power.
The efficiency of the recycling system could be improved if it is already present. In this case students can be invited to bring ideas on how they can better their campus an residence.

6123b1db379e40b4b250298a,"Sustainability is an issue that has been present in many official agendas [1] for at least 15 years in private, governmental, and educational sectors. However, as reported by the United Nations, the progress towards the goals established in Rio de Janeiro has been slower than it was hoped, it would be and in some cases we are worse than we were then [2]. Universities are not immune to this dilemma. Sometimes, “progress can be painfully slow and frustrating” [3]. As a tool to help university leaders speed up their progress towards sustainability, this article presents a model that offers a structured framework for visualizing and achieving a sustainable university system. This model can be used to assist universities to improve the effectiveness of their potential or current sustainability initiatives through the identification of strategies and opportunities for sustainability within universities.

Throughout the course of the years, there have been some institutions that have taken and followed plans of action to successfully promote sustainability initiatives, while other's sustainability initiatives have ceased to continue because of lack of support on the campus where they were implemented. What is missing is a clear orientation on exactly what a sustainable university should be. By creating this model, the authors of this manuscript seek to fill this gap through a systematic analysis designed to help university personnel understand the development of sustainability in higher education institutions.

To ensure that the sustainable university model is connected to the real world of those who will later have to implement and enjoy sustainability, findings in this paper were not derived from general concepts, but rather were extracted from empirical data obtained from many higher education institutions around the world."

We can also start a bike rental program to promote healthy living and reducing the use of cars. We can also start a campus community garden, to create a greener environment on the campus - the garden community will educate students about healthy living as well as how to maintain a green environment.  We can adapt long-term campus sustainability goals, we cannot think of achieving a sustainable environment on campus without setting goals and planning how we are going to execute it."
5641193817bdbe00122a0f23,"Sustainability is becoming ever more important in our modern world. To that end we should encourgae a circular economy of reducing, reusing and recycling. Waste should be reduced to a minimum, this could be achieved by penalising companies for packaging good in non reclycable materials, perhaps on a sliding upwards scale so each year they don't switch to recyclables and reduce their useless packaging the amount they must pay increases.

Companies should be forced to take back and reuse packaging like bottles, they could offer a small amount for each bottle retuned for example to encourage this.

People should be further encouraged to recycle; every houselhold should be provided not only with recycling bins for collection but also food waste and garden waste bins, we should work quickly towards not needing generalk waste bins at all.

People should be encouraged to consider giving away or selling items before throwinmg them away, perhaps exchange centres could be set up yo facilitate this that coul collect and deliver large items to people who need or could use them for free."
60c048ca962103e0da201a34,"Creating a sustainable university, you need to first assess what is working for the university and is serviceable for the continued future running of the future. The areas that need improving, or need to be modernized should be done in a manner that focuses on the future sustainability of the university, and should be affected in a manner in which this sustainability can be achieved. Sometimes sustainability means reinvigorating the old, and the tried and true - these areas of campus should be identified and assessed for whether any of the practices in these areas can/should be duplicated or whether they need to be blended with newer practices and technologies where applicable. For example, solar energy, although maybe would not be able to generate enough power to run the campus, the university could over time switch to solar powered lighting on the foot paths. The idea is to use what is still usable and to transition what should be transitioned with an eye to greater sustainability in the future."

A sustainable university has a clear mandate and plan to take active action to reduce waste, pollutions and exploitation of natural resources. It is forward-thinking, it innovates and creates to find sustainable energy. It takes environmental and social action on the issues that affect the communities where it is located, for example, if there exists water shortage, a sustainable university would invest in a technology that would turn sea water to fresh water or yo recycle the same water we use everyday to make it as pure and fresh as possible.

The concept of a sustainable university focuses on improving the impact that buildings and the campus have on the environment. To create a green university, you need to run projects on Organic food.
Industrial agriculture harms animals and nature through the use of pesticides, artificial fertilisers and genetically modified crops. You can make a difference, by promoting sustainable food options:

Get a Fair-Trade certification for your university
Work with local farmers to allow students and staff to buy bags with organic, local and sustainable food every week
Work with the caterer to introduce more vegetarian, organic, local, fair-trade and vegan meals and drinks
Allow students to serve meals themselves, e.g. through buffet style dining options, to reduce food waste
Donate left-over food from dining halls

Renewable energy
Gardening, landscape and biodiversity
Low-carbon transport
Clean water
Recycling
Organic food"
60fa6f5d0c4ef9c26538f610,"A sustainable university should promote the use of public transport instead of using cars, so the position of the institute should be accessibile for students who use trains, underground (...).
Another important thing is reducing the consumption of plastic: university can share water bottles to fight the eccess of plastic bottles or it can increase the number of water dispensers.
Even recovery of urban spaces is important. For example Padua University is engaging in this sector.
Lastly, is very important to apply digitization in every space of university, in order to reduce the consumption of raw materials.
Recycling is also very important: we have to reduce the amount of plastic and paper produced every day that get wasted after one only use.

6153ca3f0c560379c9ed7539,"Regarding sustainability in universities I believe one of the main priorities would be to include students and staff to fruitful discussions and exchange of ideas about possible ways to improve this issue. Some of my ideas - proposals would be:
1. Assess the existing sustainability state of the university and provide a clear picture (maybe use a sustainability score, rubric etc.).
2. Plan short-term, mid-term and long term goals and benchmarks for every aspect of sustainability. 
3. Include local community into planning (e.g. use local produce in university's meal preparation). 
4. Limit food choices to universitie's canteens and restaurants. 
5. Extensive feedback from participant groups.  
6. Go paperless
7. Educate staff and students in sustainability and provide best-practices tips and ideas that they could use both n the university and at their homes and families.

60c21f5f1389f65d2d88a3bf,"A sustainable university must put their people in the center of any action. It must involve all perspectives, including alumni, teachers, work staff, neighbors and other people that can be in contact with the university or the space that it occupies in the city. 
For a sustainable university I would say that the most important thing to do, in terms of architecture and landscaping, is to make spaces where people can meet, talk, study, learn and feel part of a community. It should also have a lot of green space where the community can spend some time and relax from the stress that university can cause. 
In terms of university culture, there should be several groups where people can join and share their likes and hobbies with one another. This will enhance multiculturalism and the sense of community between the members. 
In terms of the syllabus and what the university offers in their educational programs, there should be a variety of subjects that people can enroll in but also that observe and study the current challenges of the world in order to find solutions (be more practical than theorical). There should also be programs that look out for the future, i.e. classes regarding new technologies, new ways to obtain resources, new discoveries, etc.   "
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,Ensuring there are lots of green spaces is vital when looking at a sustainable university. There is also the idea that Solar Panels could be installed on all buildings in order to use these to sustainably produce electric to the buildings as required or dependent upon the location and viability looking at perhaps installing wind generators. Ensuring that plastic packing is not used onsite such as in the shops etc for veg and that instead students are required to reuse tubs etc to collect veg. Ensuring there are lots of recycling bins available to  make students think about recycling and ensure they do so. Perhaps in order to make this happen there could be a recycling point where per 100g/1kg of recycling you receive a voucher or money off at the shops etc. This would make people want to recycle. Another idea would be having several drinking water points on campus to ensure that people have access to these and can refill a water bottle instead of having to go and purchase another plastic bottle 
627e7e91d0e389328983e765,"Creating a sustainable university involves being aware of all of the areas of inbound supply and how much of an impact they have on our environment - to the extent that as a university, we will only do business with companies that are also trying to cut their impact on the environment. 
One idea to cut waste on campus would be to issue all members of staff and students with a re-usable drinks cup - that way we can cut down on use of single-use plastic or cardboard cups. A levy can then be charged for anyone who does not use their re-usable cup and this money can be further used to invest in limiting the university's environmental impact. 
Education modules can be included in most courses, teaching young people about ways that we can limit our impact."
61687ebcd2a35ffb762d1928,"I think the most important thing is to teach students and staff members about sustainability and what it means. Creating active campaigns that seek to promote sustainability and actually developing a compulsory module for all first years that teaches sustainability and its importance. After creating awareness about sustainability, I would implement different forums that seek to promote sustainability. A forum that promotes healthier habits, food and exercise. A forum that promotes the protection of trees and green spaces. A forum that educates people about the use of renewable energy, how to cut down the use of energy. A forum that also teaches the importance of cutting consumption and waste. I would also, offer incentives for the participation into any of these forums. "
5ea00a03e32996000ac2da80,"The great thing about a sustainable university is that you have a captive market in the age group of the students. Education is everywhere and everything so the opportunities are endless. But it starts with the building design. techniques, materials used and landscape design. Then there's transportation to consider, not just getting to and from Uni from home, but also gap year travelling and through the campus itself! lets move on to catering, less meat and more plant based foods on campus and incentives locally for bars and food places to do the same. Incentives to students to support the cause and reach out to friends and family would be a positive step too. Even offering courses on climate change would be a positive step. Young people are at their most creative when in education, so encouraging them to use this to the benefit of the cause is ripe for the picking!"

6143bbc4daab169ed298722c,"Firstly, in order to improve university sustainability , we need to make  recycling as easy as possible. Every trash bin on campus can be paired with a recycling bin for students to toss plastic bottles, paper, glass, cans and cardboard into without having to sort it all out beforehand. This will help the university to achieve a high waste diversion rate.

Secondly, Campuses are always drowning in broken/outdated electronics. That’s why setting up an e-waste collection event is a great idea for promoting campus sustainability. This can be done by contacting local recycling businesses and vendors to see what kinds of electronics they accept and make sure they are willing to accept bulk drop-offs. 

And lastly, organize a donation program during moving season, when the time comes to move out of the dorms, university students have a lot of clutter to sort through. Such as extra food, sweaters, etc., your college can save these items from the landfill and send them to those in need.

60fd425228a705aeec26c55c,"At the beginning we should put a lot of solar panels in this university, it will be good for planet and it is a cheap solution. We should do a lot of green space all over of the outside of university. Trees, flowers, grass. It will give a very good place to relax for students, it will give a shade in sunny hot days, it will look healthy and beautiful. We should get opportunities for students to get to the university by public transport or bike or electric scooter, so we should think about place, where students will left bikes and something like this, this place should be outside it should be safe and covered. About public transport.. it can be public or maybe university can do transport, few buses everyday for a symbolic amount. On the university grounds we can put up hives for the bees "
617406fbfced12169896d158,"I think that our team should consider multiple areas of sustainability. These would include waste reclamation and recycling. Planting trees around the campus. Fitting white roofs to all buildings and growing our own fruit and vegetables to be served in the cafeteria. We should also investigate how to store solar and wind energy long term so that the energy harvested in summer months could be used in the winter to provide sustainable heating. Further, we should create charging points for EV to charge from our own energy grid. There are many ways to improve our sustainability and these are just a few. We can maximize our ideas by involving all our staff and students in the brain-storming process. A competition, with a desirable prize would help to encourage everyone to submit their ideas."
61267b828ead584bcf092e35,"To sustain a university many problems need to be addressed. Firstly, the needs of students need to be met. To maintain order and sustainability people need to be treated fairly and there must be equality among them. For instance, for people with disabilities fair arrangements need to be made for everyone to not be discriminated or feel left out. Education must reach every student equally. Resources of the school must be handled with care, so that the information given by the school to the pupils must of high standard and quality. Physical maintenance of the premises must also be adhered to and a routine must be kept by the managers of the school for things to run smoothly in every faculty. From lecturer, tutor and student, quality information must be administered at all times in order to maintain the university's status and stature. The government must also provide funding to maintain the premises and quality education or information of the university to sustain itself in the long run."
56cf6e8d31a5bc0006e1cdf5,"Harping back to the previous question, I feel one almost needs to go back in time to be sustainable. For example when I went to Uni, I lived at home with my parents instead of requiring separate accommodation and travel. The picture above suggests though that we are looking at the now modern campus structure. With lots of trees!
The accomodation should be well built and occupied year round, by students in term time and as holiday lets in summer. The lecture theatres should be more available to the general public for events and sports facilities available for use by all, particularly the obese referred by GPs for exercise therapy.
During the pandemic, some online courses ran successfully - the best parts of that could be included in some courses going forward. Lots of public transport should be visiting the campus and maybe cars could be banned except for loading/unloading at the start/end of term. Again, these ideas seem unoriginal but hey I am no expert!"
5d3873197860c8001a106e02,"It's very important that all things should be sustainable. To make a university sustainable it should look kind of like on this picture. A lot of grass, trees, greens. The ecosystem should be selfsustainable. Solar cells should provide electricity and if there is a river nearby they could use it for energy and they could build wind turbines. There should be a lot of recycle bins that they can use. Students should be educated from a very early age to be awere of climate change what what they can do about it. All the electric things in the university should be energy saver. They shouldn't use paper books only tablets and digital boards. That would save a lot of trees and that would be good for the climate on the long run. These are my ideas ."
6173d266422990874e02c3b7,"For the new university building, the company responsible for the build should plant a trees around it, use eco-friendly building material and finishes, and make the said building energy efficient. The campuses can be solar powered, and the streets or tar used can have some sensors so that when people walk, or cars drive o them they can in turn generate some energy which can be processed into power for lights or other electricity needs. Fish can be used as part of the eco-system for all the plants in the university. Cars that use the normal fuel can be charged for entry.
The university should be built in such a way that is causes little to no disturbance to nature by erecting the builds around any streams or over them. Any water found should be used to harness energy and the water used in the building can be recycled for plants. Rainwater can be collect using special gutters and stored, distilled for everyday use.
The building roofs can be used gardens and the water in those gardens can be recycled and distilled for use to generate some form of power. Any animals found there should be protected within the premises while they are able to move freely, hence building over or around nature is advised
 Less trees should be used in the building and 50% or of the land in the university should incorporate the preservation of trees and other forms of nature found in the area. A building code or regulation should be in place to ensure the university adheres to it and some form of discount/rebates can be claimed for the adherence of those regulations.

60fe7c857e049641f422a6f4,"University campuses span large plots of land reaching many kilometers. They have large buildings and many open spaces. There are many practices that a university should employ as part of their standard operating procedures in order to ensure that they are a sustainable institution. These practices include the installation of solar panels in most to all buildings on campus, the installation of solar geysers in all staff and student residences that services large numbers of individuals. Another important fact is that universities see the use of vast amounts of paper and paper related stationery. It would be prudent to implement a recycle policy following the records keeping periods. If, for example, the institution has a 5-year records keeping policy, all documents exceeding 5 years should be placed into a recycling facility that produces resources that can be integrated back into the university. An alternative to this, would be to make use of modern technology and advance to becoming paper-free facilities. Students would be able to access all study materials and information online. There would be online systems for administrative documents that can be completed electronically. Students would also be able to write tests and exams on electronic devices as opposed to sit down exams printed on paper. Post graduate students should submit their dissertations and theses electronically and thus eliminating the cost and need for printing of these documents.

What we take away from the earth should be given back. Heating with fossil fuels which, after all, will one day run out can be converted to solar energy. Irrigation systems that water the greenery on campus should be replaced with water not from the water supply but, for example, rainwater. Our university should, in addition to being equipped with the right systems to produce heat and electricity, also have the right choice of materials for construction. They must be energy efficient which will reduce energy consumption. An example of such materials is thermal insulation with increased thickness. In addition, we have a huge canteen, it produces tens of kilograms of organic waste with the help of a biogas plant (microbial gas plant). This will allow us to use crop residues, manure or other organic waste to produce biogas, which can be used to heat the university or generate electricity. The most popular and easiest biogas plant to build is the container microgas plant. It consists of a set of two containers that can be easily installed and used. Biogas is one type of alternative energy source, these are ideas for a sustainable university of the future! In central Europe, where the climate is temperate, central heating must be provided for large population centers including universities. If you build energy-efficient buildings, you should use heat pumps for this, which draw heat from the ground, air or water. The type of pump used depends on the conditions that prevail in the area where the university is located.

60f9baa99f49184f083a9ce8,"The following essay will cover ideas towards achieving a sustainable university. A sustainable university is an educational institution that places a high priority on sustainability, educates students to become global citizens for sustainable development, provides pertinent insights on pressing societal issues, and reduces the environmental and social footprint of its campus operations. Universities have a significant impact on how young people develop and are empowered to become global citizens who support sustainable development. Giving students the tools they need to learn about sustainability in an interdisciplinary and learner-centered manner is one of a sustainable university's key responsibilities. Students can find the answers to significant social concerns through research. Academics at a sustainable university can conduct research to identify solutions to pressing social issues. Students should investigate the institution's research practices and how it relates to issues like addressing global hunger, economic inequality, and climate change. Research from universities can support sustainable changes if its questions are socially pertinent and its conclusions are made widely available. Achieving a zero footprint for campus operations should be a model for university operations. Universities should investigate how energy-efficient lighting and garbage recycling might be implemented on their campuses to maximize energy use. By analyzing and minimizing the environmental and social footprints of structures, purchasing procedures, and laboratories, a university can support sustainability. Finally, universities need to strategically prioritize sustainability. While it's fantastic to work on individual projects to promote sustainability in operations, education, research, and the university community, universities won't succeed in becoming sustainable institutions unless it is a strategic goal. Making sustainability a strategic priority, implementing new organizational structures, and tracking its success can help universities improve sustainability in research, education, operations, and the university community."

Students coming to the university on bicycles have free bottled mineral water, and the university's economic employees are obliged to help with their repair. In our canteen, we do not sell beverages in plastic bottles, we do not use plastic cutlery or cups. We offer the poorest students tablets so that they do not use traditional notebooks for documents / notes in electronic form. We encourage you to choose paper materials showing pro-environmental features, e.g. raw material from sustainable forestry, content of secondary raw material, no bleaching or bleaching without the use of chlorine, susceptibility to multiple use, product design that allows easy separation of elements from different materials Printing documents that are not considered necessary will cost double, and for the multiple littering of the university area, the students receive a lower grade in the defense of their studies.

Second, they could harness renewable resources such as the sun, wind and hydroelectricity to produce energy without harming the environment. Involving students in change could positively influence many families, leading them to reduce their environmental impact and make more responsible choices towards the environment. An idea that would allow to reduce the energy consumption necessary for transport is to build dormitories for students: in this way all emissions due to the movement of their commutes can be avoided. As for the design of the university buildings, building constructions with large windows would save electricity needed for lighting, using natural light. To reduce the environmental impact, then, materials of natural origin and low environmental impact, such as wood, could be used.

The concept of sustainable development refers to building structures that are environmentally friendly and make efficient use of natural resources. During its entire lifespan, such buildings are resource-efficient and eco-friendly, from construction to demolition. In these types of developments, natural resources such as water, energy, and materials are used efficiently while reducing the negative effects of the building on the environment and the health of its occupants.

Infrastructure upgrades usually lag behind the need, even when the resources are available. Massive changes can be made in good energy production as most Universities use massive amounts of energy, investment in long-term sustainable energy will be an investment in both the environment and the future of the university. 

Furthermore – the University would want to invest in moving for changes in the transportation system like cycling paths in the town; specifically to the University as this is a huge transportation hub. It would additionally be smart to give availability in one way or another bikes for the students, a transportation system which is sustainable in every way.

Society and even the environment we live in is changing constantly. Let us look back at our last two years. Many universities and schools had to turn to technology as many classes and lessons were conducted more online than in person.

Looking at the societal change many people realised that they may not want to work that 9 to 5 job anymore. As a result universities intake has declined, so the questions arises; how do we ensure that university remains sustainable when considering the societal and environmental factors that are constantly changing?

the answer is simple, we monitor the change and adjust, if we are constantly on target with what is happening around us in society and the environment while ensuring it  does result in the depletion of resources and that there is a constant need to provide relevant resources. relevant resources could include that universities are providing courses that are demand with many sources of knowledge.

Knowledge is continuously growing evolving and universities need to do the same in order to obtain sustainability.

I will be easy for them to also revert back to their lecturers everything they missed during the class time. "

Furthermore, such a university would be able to incorporate social cohesiveness and economic development aswell. This can be done by having the university actively advocate for the education of and conservation of nature including educating people on the rights that protect nature and the maintenance of its integrity and respect and most importantly ways in which people can co-exist respectfully with nature. Having recycling bins and encouraging the use of them has been one common way of sustaining the environment around university campuses. This is a culture that can be cultivated amongst the learners at the university and even beyond."
604d603b057fd944c370a451,"The biggest problem in a university in terms of sustainability relies in the waste of their resources, mainly in the form of using spaces.

As a university grows, so does the way they use their space, and the first option is always to use the green areas to build the new classrooms and laboratories, but that means that eventually all the resources of space would be used.

An option would be to start using subterranean space in the building of the new study places, that way the university can have bigger buildings without having the need to occupy more space, and eventually this will mean that the expansion of the university can occur, but it won't use all the space resources so quickly.

There is also the posibility of mobile laboratories that can be used and then moved to another place, but that may be a little stretch."

Students and faculty members alike should be looking for ways to make an impact on the environment and go green at school with some great environmental sustainability ideas.
You don’t need paper notebooks. Use your laptop to take notes and keep track of assignments and meetings. 
Reusable bags are great for carrying other classroom items and supplies.
One good reusable bottle to refill throughout the day could replace many plastic bottles you use throughout the day.
Install recycling bins everywhere. More is more. 
Composting the waste from cafeteria can bring on some interesting results not only for the biology class. 
For example - for the campus garden. Grow your own produce, create an oasis to rest in, and cool down the air without the use of AC. 
Bike, walk, use public transport. 
CFL or LED bulbs not only provide a better quality of light, but they also use less electricity. And remember to flip the switch off when leaving the room!
Step away from plastic or paper cutlery, plates, and towels. Buy real ones and learn from your mum how to do the dishes. 
Recycling is not only for waste. Donate useful items that you don’t need anymore. 
Go digital – in classroom and in the dorm. Don’t print out anything you don’t need. Submit online wherever you can. 
Use less water. Turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth and cut down on shower time as much as possible to conserve water.

5e6473fbc15dbe1f71eea95b,"Universities are quite pollutionous as courses require each student to purchase and emase books that sometimes cost more than the course itself, there needs to be a buyback solution implemented in these institutions in terms of course materials. Downloadable content is a very viable option as well. Minor changes in a course book's copy every year in attempts to sell the same standard book for a slightly higher price for the following year's class needs to be addressed. These schools often have quite a substantial footprint thus have ample room to install solar panels and other naturally derived resources, greenspace can be placed atop lower standing buildings as well. Ride sharing should be encouraged. Online learning is a very viable option. "

2. Take notes electronically – Instead of using paper notebooks and agendas, use your laptop to take notes and keep track of assignments and meetings. Solar outdoor classrooms have become a new trend that many schools and businesses are implementing!
3. Purchase reusable bags – Not only are these great for groceries, they can also be used to carry other classroom items and supplies.
4. Invest in one good water bottle – Stop buying and using plastic water bottles. Instead, find a nice, reusable bottle (can be found at any pharmacy) to refill throughout the day. If water quality is a problem, simply buy a filter for your sink, or a pitcher with a built-in water filter to keep in the refrigerator.
5. Recycle – One of the oldest tricks in the “sustainability book” is also one of the most effective. If your room or building does not have a bin available, request one from your school.
6. Compost – See if it is possible for your campus to provide a compost bin for food waste from the cafeteria.
7. Create a campus garden – Plant a garden to beautify your space, or use it to grow some of your own vegetables.
8. Be smart about transportation – It is widely known that automobile emissions are a significant contributor to pollution. Offset this by biking or walking where possible, or take your campuses public transportation to classes.
