Unique ID,"Veganism is a controversial topic among many people in recent days, and often results in heated debates. What are your thoughts and opinions on veganism, and on the people who advocate veganism? Discuss anything and everything about veganism, it's pros and cons, whether it's beneficial or detrimental to the society, and so on. Tip: Veganism is about preventing creutly to animals, and avoiding consumption of animal products. "
5f19559b9665f700090276c4,"I fully support veganism and so does science, at least for the most part. It's a proven method of lowering one's carbon footprint while promoting compassion and welfare for sentient beings who have been proven to feel pain and suffering just as humans do and are subject to abhorrent conditions and treatment on most mainstream farms. Animal agriculture is harmful to the animals themselves, the environment (which suffers from mass deforestation and erosion due to our relentless demand for meat and animal products), and nearby communities who deal with polluted air and water and resulting mental health issues. Veganism could be a workable solution to limit these impacts, and it may also help to address many of our modern lifestyle diseases, including heart disease, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, type II diabetes and morbid obesity. Most of these conditions can be reversed or treated by a diet high in fibre, low in saturated fat, and full of health promoting antioxidants and plant compounds. However, veganism needs to be carefully adhered to in order to be nutritionally sound, and this may be challenging for people from impoverished backgrounds or with limited knowledge or access to dietary specialists who can advise them on how to adopt veganism in a healthy way. However, for those with the resources and knowledge available, veganism is a viable option for fighting climate change, promoting the welfare of farmed animals, and ensuring ongoing good health to whatever degree possible."
611e1f608f92b6c9b825bcca,"A vegan diet is a plant based lifestyle that prohibits the consumption of all animal products, with many people adopting a vegan diet for health, environmental and strong ethical beliefs concerning animal welfare.

The main problem with veganism is that not everyone has the capability to follow a vegan diet and you must follow it for the right reasons, not just to lose weight. Some packaged foods will have ingredients unsuitable for vegans, but adopting a diet that focuses on natural and fresh produce makes it much easier to control.

Pros :
- Obtain a variety of vegetables and fruits each day
-Useful diet for weight loss
- Increased feelings of satiety (high food volume, low energy intake)
- High intake of fiber
- Helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and heart disease: One of the significant contributing elements to heart disease is your diet. The vegan diet prioritises a wealth of natural, nutrient-dense plant-based foods that promote heart health. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc., all have excellent health properties.

Cons 
- Vegan diets can be low in protein and fat
-Vegan diets can be low in protein and fat
-When dieting, especially in athletes, higher protein intakes are advised to promote muscle retention & recovery, combat hunger, and enhance mood

This means that the vegan diet pros and cons balance each other out. Well-designed vegetarian and vegan diet recipes neither hinder nor aid performance, compared to an already well-structured diet that includes animal products."
60f1ce6483f717f5272dfeee,"Vegetarianism/ Veganism Pros and Cons
Vegetarian & vegan diets are more popular than ever, particularly for athletes in an attempt to maximize performance.

There are many benefits of a plant-based diet and are claimed to be the healthiest diet to follow because they prioritize naturally sourced plant based foods (fruits and vegetables, legumes, and whole grains).

This is great and exactly how all diets should be but are there any downsides to a plant-based diet? Just to be clear, I am in no way against vegan diet plan, I just want to outline any potential risks and help all athletes who choose to adopt a plant based diet to get the best results.

Pros Of Being Vegan
Helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and heart disease: One of the significant contributing elements to heart disease is your diet. The vegan diet prioritizes a wealth of natural, nutrient-dense plant-based foods that promote heart health. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc., all have excellent health properties.

The research of 126 omnivorous men and 170 vegetarians showed that those who adopted a vegetarian diet had lower blood pressure and a lower probability of coronary heart disease.

Helps to improve blood sugar levels: Type 2 diabetes is a global health issue. However, some studies show that a vegan diet plays a specific role in improving blood sugar levels. It typically reduces the intake of poor quality processed foods overconsumed in typical Western diets and contributes to type 2 diabetes."
60e0d0e810dc0d3c0eb7ea90,"The question of what it is to be a vegetarian has been erroneously answered time and time again by those who follow the diet guided by their instinct. Therefore, to fully understand essential vegetarianism, it is necessary to start at the beginning, that is, its definition.

Vegans eat exclusively plant foods or, in other words, do not eat animals or animal products. However, a vegan lifestyle is much more than food. Whether it's caring for animals, the environment, or your own health, there are plenty of reasons to choose a 100% plant-based lifestyle. ProVeg explains more about vegan nutrition.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the consumption of animals is the main cause of many of the world's problems. Since plant-based nutrition is a concrete solution to solve these issues, lifestyle and diet without animal products are rapidly gaining momentum. A plant-based diet saves animals from a lifetime of suffering, reduces the ecological footprint at the individual level, and contributes to a fairer world. At the same time, eating a plant-based diet can also contribute to a more varied and healthier diet.

Throughout history, vegetarianism has always had a function, be it for religious, political or social reasons. The concept of vegetarianism and veganism dates back at least 6,000 years with the first records of Hindu cultures, but even in Europe, 2,500 years ago, some Greek schools of philosophy already rejected the consumption of meat, eggs and milk for ethical reasons. while affirming that an exclusively vegetable diet is healthier. However, the term vegan did not appear until 1944 and is based on the beginning and the end of the word vegetarian (veg-etari-ano), reflecting the idea that veganism starts from vegetarianism and leads to a logical conclusion."
5f67738a1aadce071e716263,"Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan. Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. 
A lot of people practice veganism for health reasons and some for religious reasons. There are a lot of pros, but also a lot of cons to veganism. Some cons include that alternative have to be brought into ones diet to be able to sustain a healthy lifestyle. A pro on the other hand is that there are not a lot of preservatives being consumed that are usually found in meat.
A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases."
616721ae6f6c6b77a7242f41,"Although man has been an omnivore since birth, the level of meat consumption in recent times is not natural for humans. Certainly, meat has helped the evolution of the human species as we know it today. Children need meat for proper development. But is it necessary to consume meat in the quantities we consume today? The answer is simple, certainly not. It is neither healthy nor sustainable. We certainly do not want you to become vegetarians or vegans. But try to think about what eating meat causes. There are many problems, ranging from animal cruelty to environmental problems. Meat is a great raw material, but it should be treated as such. That means with respect, care and also with an attitude as if it were precious. It is not about the air, which is all around us and there is virtually an unlimited amount of it."
60b6868793cf7b832392a38b,"Veganism can be quite positive when considering the animals and their suffering as well as the environmental benefits. However, we cannot expect people to choose veganism on a blink. People who advocate veganism are usually extremely aggressive about the way they conduct their speech with others while defending their beliefs. While veganism is a noble choice, not everyone is ready to change their habits completely. We should firstly influence people to reduce their intake, further encouraging them to choose more sustainable and beneficial choices like veganism.
Currently, many people are starting to understand the influence eating habits have on the daily life of someone and the environment in general.  Therefore, many have started to choose more adequate solutions."
5ede17df5600b50241a7443d,"I personally don't take place in veganism, at the same time I am not a vegetarian person but I do really respect both views. First off, I think it should be mentioned that what anyone does shouldn't be of anyone's concern except of themselves unless it damages or affects anyone else, which veganism does not. I personally think it's even admirable how this group of people will change their ways of live just to help animals all around, and I think it does indeed make a difference, because with how many of them there has been through time production surely has needed to adapt, even if only just one small bit.
I personally have never really considered myself to change my whole diet and go vegan and maybe I won't ever do it, but I do admire everyone who does."
6114242b9bb244326ceb185f,"veganism is the answer to many problems. sustainability being one of the first ones. 
the carbon emissions from the intensive farming are borderline ridicoulus, and easily avoided, all of the soil filled with grains to be force fed to caged animals could be used for humans and to reduce world famine instead of force feeing animals to be eaten. 
i wouldnt be transparent if i didn't say that i am not in fact vegan, i have been for several years but i have stopped because it became a social burden and time consuming. being vegan in a world of non vegans require organization time and money, although some dishes are very easy to prepare or come across is not always that straightforward. i still avoid meat and animal products, but if i crave them i will consume them. a big part of veganism is thin centred and health centered, but it doesnt have to be that way.

6038e63a1713653046ef7482,"I can understand people who have consciously given up meat. He does this not only for his health but also for the good of the planet. In my home, I limit the consumption of meat and meat products. replace meat with plant products and eggs. I set up a vegetable garden so that for half a year I was eating my natural vegetables and fruits. I know what I'm eating. I do not have to buy these products in the store. I try to cook healthy, buy only those things that are needed and not waste food. I do a lot of things myself, juices, jams, pickles. We switched to eating more fish, eggs, less chicken and pork. We gave up eating beef altogether.  teaches his child respect for food, that it must not be thrown away and wasted. I'm not yet gtotowa to completely give up meat but I have limited its consumption very much."
6137aaf89c3f9544d0232079,"Veganism is a belief and philosophy that one takes and stands that animals should be preserved and not killed. Many people see veganism as way of life and keep the world a better place and not harming and some see it as a step to show humanity nt only to people but also extend it to animals as well. One has a right to choose and decide what they believe in and do as they believe, if vegans believe that killing of animals is wrong then one should not judge them or beliitle them for the humanity and compassion they show to animals. Some believe that animals and humans can communicate and have an understanding and they feel pain hence they do not kill them and they are vegans. Being a vegan can be a way of life that others see fit to have a long and healthy life as animals can be said to be unhealthy however eating vegetables is healthy and no one ever got sick by eating vegetables unlike some sicknesses caused by eating meat of an animal. "
6108033c1bf591fee2013a07,"Veganism is a lifestyle that excludes meat, eggs, dairy and all other animal products.

Despite the pushback it's been getting, it is becoming increasingly popular as people are more aware of the negative effects of consuming animal products. One of the main reasons for this trend is the prevalence of documentaries about animal cruelty. like ""Blackfish"" and ""Earthlings"". 

Personally, I'm not quite sure what to make of veganism. I support its advocacy relating to not testing products on animals. On the other hand, I don't think I could not eat cheesecake or enjoy barbeque grilled chicken wings. 

A major pro in going vegan is that you eat more fruits and vegetables and subsequently can lose a lot of weight. Unfortunately, a disadvantage associated with veganism is not taking in enough nutrients your body needs. Some vegans are deficient in certain B-vitamins, which are essential for helping our body's cells function optimally.

I think some vegan activists can come across as quite obnoxious, especially when they start preaching to and condemning people who would otherwise be willing to listen if they weren't insufferable.

Some vegans espouse the health benefits of veganism in a dogmatic way, but they themselves engage in a slew of unhealthy activities. These include using substances, being short-tempered, abusing alcohol, etc.

However, the role they play in advocating for better treatment of animals can not and must not be understated. As insufferable as they can be at times, they apply pressure to organizations and governments when it comes to animal rights. And we should commend them for that."
6111b8bc982e6972a924ee7c,"Being a vegan means that you do not consume anything that comes from animals,basically different from a vegetarian that consumes vegetables and some other products derived from animals. I'm for veganism and I support that idea and I strongly believe people who are vegan love it and are doing good to the animals,  however as humans we need many nutrients and vitamins derived from meat which vegans do not consume.  That means they won't get necessary nutrients from meat as they don't eat it thus getting limited and insufficient nutrients from their vegan diet plans. Another good thing about vegans is they are against animal cruelty therefore saving the lives of animals which shows compassion for the animals. Vegans food diets saves them from gaining too much fat and keep them in good shape and healthy as they don't consume too much fat and mostly eat non meat food "
5bed50471f9cac0001734381,"Veganism is a very healthy lifestyle that is introduced in our society the last years but it should not be taken lightly, since it affects the person’s life in a great way. Personally, I would not become a vegan soon, because I have different dietary preferences from this group of people. However, I believe it is more of a trend for some of the people who practice it. I have seen multiple times that some vegans are pretty vocal about their preferences and how others should follow their example. In some cases, I don’t actually believe some people choose it because they feel comfortable with the vegan food, but more for the “hip” part of it. Someone can make a choice and not enforce others to make the options as he/she. I believe veganism has some pretty good points, like the non-animal-cruelty part and the non-harmful habits for the planet and can be very sustainable. On the other hand, it narrows down the dietary options of the person involved, since it rules out a lot of foods with nutrients that can be acquired only from food deriving from animals, like meat, eggs and milk. Vegans have found ways around it, by using a lot of spices and lots of ingredients on a single dish, but I do not believe it’s very effective. This of course, is my personal opinion. All in all, I believe that veganism is a good thing for the planet and the animals, but it has some downsides when it comes to health. Of course, many variations of veganism are out there, like vegetarians. I strongly believe that each of us should turn to more eco-friendly food, but not at the expense of our health. It is a personal dietary plan and everyone could have a go at discovering what work for them."
600a9ab59e9b701db49fbec1,"I think it's beneficial but it shouldn't be imposed on people to use it. Many of the agricultural areas are for the cultivation of pasture for the animals that, if planted with vegetables, would be used directly for human consumption. Being vegan is being a friend of the planet in my opinion.
For the people who are opposed, I think that meat consumption should be reduced or at least a limit should be imposed. Fish should be banned to save the oceans and replace animal life and stop polluting fishing nets and killing fish.
Being vegan is also not using any animal products like the clothes we wear, measures that protect nature and biodiversity.
Being vegan doesn't have many cons in my opinion, apart from the vitamin B12 deficit that can easily be ingested by vitamin supplements. People should be informed more about this way of life and start to transition gradually. I think that's the only way to save the planet. Universities, governments and associations should promote a healthier, more sustainable and planet-friendly lifestyle. The planet and people only benefit from taking good care of it."
5f15ed8fd44ced12e0336ff5,"Being a vegetarian, I highly support going vegan. It sure does have some cons to it as having a trouble to achieving protein needs or one would say limited food choices or the concern of nutrient deficiencies, but as far as I know going vegan has much more pros to it. Not only is it good for the planet and animals, but also encourages mindful eating, reduces food costs, helps with weight loss and has evidence-based health benefits. Since a vegan diet is plant-based it is easier to consume and load up on health whole grains, vegetables and fruits that a lot of people tend to skip on when following a regular diet. Eating a rich in plant-based foods diet decreases a risk of many chronic diseases. Going vegan definitely requires dilligence, like reading nutrition labels, but it is worth it!"
60c1da4f43673b0d9446078e,"Nowadays there is a lot of stigma around vegans, but the truth is when you are going to deepen the topic most of it are false informations. Going vegan is a journey not a one day thing. You can't change your lifestyle in one night. So firstly you need to do a lot of research not only the online one, but also run some tests and ask your doctor about it, because unfortunately veganism is not for everyone, but it shouldn't discourage you from maybe at least consume less meat. First and most common adventage can be that you save a lot of lives, not only animals but also your. Sometimes veganism can be really good to yourself because you will eat less fats, but also eating less meat means less CO2 production, so you saving the people who live on the planet. A lot of people can be easily descourge by the time it takes, and by the prices of some vegan food. But the truth is it can be beneficial to your wallet, but at the same time you need to remember that you don't need all those fancy vegan-meats becouse you can easily make them your self. "
60eaac9e9b27ce557bd8fc58,"Going vegan is a good idea for those who want to stay healthy and conserve the planet but at the same time if all we could go vegan then how are we going to do with animals? That would mean that in the world we would have more and more animals that they do not even have a land to stay at , then that would mean that the food chain would not be balanced because we would end up having more animals than humans. The benefits of being a vegan is that you are definitely healthy and have strong immune system but the cons of it is that the are certain proteins that other meats contain that the body might need like fish ,so it means being a vegan you wouldn't be having a balanced diet.The cons of also making everyone be a vegan is that it means businesses will suffer of those who are selling the livestock and since livestock are a big part of the economy then the economy might collapse 
"
611da2edb4dd06832bb888b1,This topic boils down to what is nature. Boils down to if you believe in the origins of life and what is it God intended for us to do and live. Everyone is entitled to how they want to live their lives and how they want to do whatever they want. It's no sin to eat animals as other animals eat others it's part of ecosystem if you choose to be vegan so be it bur you can't deny someone freedom of practicing ecosystem that already existed thousands of years it's just of things unfortunately. One person can look at it as animal cruelty but in actual fact it's not. Animals are not made to live long their life span is very short thus their reproduction rate is 5 times of that of humans even when they are slaughtered they won't go extinct because of slaughtering but they will go extinct because of climate change. They're made to be eaten for pleasure of mankind and their creator is the one that made them be not human. Not eating animals can have serious catastrophic domino in our livelihoods. 
5eaeb365086d90570e8e538f,"Veganism is a noble idea, and a radical change in the face of the world's current consumption habits. It's desire to reduce harm is a great initiative, but it fails to address the issues of permacultures created by large scale industrial farming and the havoc that this practice wreaks on many natural environments. Whilst the current status quo is certainly undesirable and leading to many climate issues, swinging back to the other direction will lead to different issues and overwhelm bio-controls that are in place to combat harmful alien invaders into certain areas.
People who advocate veganism should be encouraged to do so, even if they are often militant and hard-line in their beliefs. But if their influence even extends simply into non-vegans redressing parts of their own habits and introducing practices such as only eating meat on certain days of the week, then that can only be positive and be the start of a mindful change.  "
6065dcc8bc4a1f1663e4d13b,Veganism is a very good idea but difficult to execute. Its almost impossible to try to convince everyone turn vegan because we are so addicted to eating meat and this would require to change everyone's eating habit. It is very important because it helps on the cruelty of animals. But I think its something that you need to feel the need to do and not be obliged to. We can try to normalize it more but it will be a long run because not everyone worries that much about animals. Its very benificial to our world but creates a bit hatred between vegans and non vegans wich is a really bad thing. Im not vegan but I try to eat more vegetables and meat replacements so one day maybe I can be meat free. This will help us in many things but I think its a very difficult objective. But I think that our descendents will be more concerned about this things and it will be easier
6175c8df7d130a584b8d9d5c@email.prolific.co,"while there are documented health benefits of vegan diet, some find the lifestyle challenging to maintain. The pros of choosing this diet include evidence based health benefits, encourages mindful eating, wider range of foods, may lead to weight loss, reduced food costs, healthier for the environment and no animal impact. The cons include limited food choices, possible nutrient deficiencies, requires diligence, difficulty dining out, unrealistic expectations and social isolations. The reasons an individual chooses a vegan eating plan will determine the benefits that are most relevant for you. But advantages of this lifestyle are substantial, regardless of whether you are choosing it for health, environmental, or ethical reasons. Comparing different types of diets have found vegan ranks highest for nutritional quality. The nutritional quality of a vegan diet leads to more significant health benefits. Eating a diet rich in plant-based foods has been associated with a decreased risk of many chronic diseases"
5e82fb37e833ed000a41a42c,"Veganism may be a controversial topic but the benefits for our health, animals and the environment are clear. While diet is a personal choice, society should incentivise veganism instead of treating it like a niche, often inconvenient lifestyle.
With rising concerns about the environment, one of the major pros of veganism is that it cuts your carbon footprint. Experts say that we would regain 3/4 of our agricultural land if we stopped using it for cattle. Even if people do not go totally vegan, everyone should stop eating beef and reduce their meat consumption to help avert climate catastrophe.
Another heavily debated pro of veganism is the benefits for your health. Again, the primary culprit here is beef and dairy products which are linked to intestinal issues and colon cancer. Dieticians seem to agree that the best diet is a Mediterranean one which is high in fruit, vegetables, fish, and white meat. But people can healthy, long lives with no animal products whatsoever.
Finally, and most importantly for some, animals are sentient and should not suffer. There have been many attempts to explain meat-eating as human nature or natural order. However, the simple truth is that we don't need to let animals suffer and we choose to anyway. 
The problem is that eating meat is a huge part of people's culture and identity. We will not make progress by shaming them. Instead, we need to encourage veganism and challenge the rhetoric that being a carnivore is more masculine. "
61140ecd6c72bb8ce54d0ac8,"It is a well known fact for starters that animal husbandry has massive CO2 implications hence veganism is a welcome movement in my opinion. Although we might advocate for abolishment of animal husbandry the sector employs a number of people and has various complementary businesses associated to it. Introduction of veganism will therefore be a big disrupter in this regard. 

Introducing veganism will mean a bumper influx of animals as they continuously reproduce without anyone consuming them which will have a massive strain on the limited resources that we as humans will provide for these animals to survive and reproduce.

Veganism will lead to more vegetable based diets that will be so beneficial to the human race as plant based products are healthier and will lead to an eradication of certain diseases which medical research has clearly outlined that certain human diseases are because of meat consumption."
60fdc6bd99694fa57bdc303e,"The first thing that should be clear is that veganism is different than vegetarianism. Vegans often use the wrong approach with people in convincing them with this idea, because no matter what they do or say, if they always attack non vegans for being so, it is not going to work. You can't expect from someone who is being called a murderer to agree with you, especially when they don't mind eating meat or having diary products in the first place. 
As much as I agree with the idea of people being vegetarians because they are against the cruelty and the killing of animals, I don't agree with vegans. The whole idea is not convincing enough, not consuming animal products is not a way for addressing any issue because for example, having eggs or milk or any other diary product will not affect the animal and it is not considered cruelty. With all due respect to all vegans for their beliefs and their way of living, something is not quite right in the whole idea. "
5abd8d6ba3ba7a0001b4602b,"Is vegan really the way to save the planet? Or is vegan just an extremist idea that will slowly ruin us all? Tons of researchs will tell you both, that vegan is the only salvation to the world as it is today, and that vegan is what will kill the population if everyone decides to adopt it. Veganism has, obviously, it's pros and cons. The biggest pro is, obviosuly, the amount of animals that are saved. It's no mystery that our daily nutrition nowadays isn't the best for the environment: we consume way to much meat, a lot more than necessary. Our past generations weren't used to this much animal protein, and were still healthy! These days, with new information and science, you can find proteins and vitamins from non animal sources, making it easier to save the lives of milions of animals. The meat and milk industries are some of the worst industries around, and the amount of animal brutality happening in them is absolutely horrible. Of course, veganism isn't just the solution and can raise some problems. Veganism can be harmful for our own health, causing (for example), causing blood pressure problems. The best way to change is to study the possibility, learn how to do it safely and then act. "
60faab394a1729764adb9a29,"Meat has been part of the diet of humanity for thousands of years. I think one can still eat meat without being cruel to animals. Many cultures have actually passed on traditions on how you can kill an animal for food without causing it to suffer. The protein in meat is of a higher quality for the human body. Veganism can be dangerously unhealthy if done without any support from a dietician or some kind of food guru...and sadly, very few people can afford this. Also, to be a vegan, the food has to be of a higher quality and hence more expensive, which is unaffordable for most of the world's population. High quality vegan staples such as Brazil nuts, Macademian nuts, etc. and the like cost a premium, sadly, even people who grown then in their native environment can no longer afford them. I think it is a lifestyle of the privileged who have unlimited options."
5db9870052e7df000a11af99,"Veganism is maximum based. The oddest thing about discussion around veganism is that anyone in a sound state of mind would agree with the idea. Because what is veganism? It's about not causing unnecesary harm. Find even 1 person, if asked ""Would you cause truly unnecesary harm?"", who'd then answer ""Yes, I would."" and not have them checked in for a psych-test. No one would say that. Veganism is simply a matter of living in a way that aligns your actions with your pre-existing moral compass. 

The reason most people fight tooth and nail against veganism is, often, not because they actually disagree with it, but because they are either uneducated (""We need meat for protein and milk for calcium"" is factually untrue) or because they simply don't want to come to terms with the fact that this whole time they've been doing something they personally disagree with (i.e. causing unnecessary harm.)

There are so many (bad) arguments people make against veganism, but often they are all entirely baseless, or entirely irrelevant to the person making those arguments. To pick out any one example of fallacy-laden arguments would only open up the opportunity for a passer by to read it, dismiss it as strawmanning, and pick another argument to stick by, even though it's probably completely invalid too.

As for vegan activism, of course people dismiss the more enthusiastic activists as ""extreme"" because the alternative is to accept that their point is correct. As much as people mock the point, imagine if womens rights of anti-racial prejudice activists said ""oh, sorry, was that a bit rude? I'll tone it down a little."" Obviously they'd never have gotten anywhere. Rosa Parks and MLK didn't hand out flyers on the streets, they assembled thousands of people. Gary Youofsky turned about 10% of Israel vegan with his comparison of what animals experience and what the Jew people exerienced under Nazi Germany. Yes, humans and non-human animals are a world apart in some regards, but the idea is the same. Animals want to live their own lives just as much as humans, and we have no _valid_ reason to take that away from them.

Beyond that; the cons of veganism. Conveniently for vegans, there are almost none. Some people might have the most obscure diseases imaginable or someone actually does live in a food dessert. And perhaps primarily, veganism does require internationalisation of food logistics. But considering this already exists (mostly for animal feed but also for people), those logistics aren't so far fetched. And lastly, some people are concerned that that wars will make those logistics difficult, and becoming self sustaining without import impossible. Which of course is a miserable mindset. War is possible, so I must kill? If everyone was raised with a vegan mindset, ""to be kind to all beings regardless of differences"" then where in that mindset is the room for harming humans with racism, or sexism, or homophobism, or war?

The downside of this one-sided writing is that a non-vegan will read this, think of (invalid) counter arguments, and I won't be able to explain why those arguments are invalid. So, in closing, rest assured that any argument you think of probably is not valid, and yes, you too can feel morally consistant and factually correct all the time if you become vegan.

How's that for 300 word limit?"
610348b82cae8b9ba4f2d9dd,"I believe veganisim should be a personal choice. Humans are after all, animals, and it's in our nature to feed off from other animals (animal behavior). Should humans do away with eating of meat or other animals if it is against their belief or religious purposes? He'll yes, should they be allowed to impose their beliefs to others? Most certainly not, although it must be noted that man is selfish, a man never returns to the ecosystem, all man do is take and take, which I believe that's where veganism is thoughtful, man eats plants which are primary consumers but hardly plants back, man eats meat but do not feed the decomposers once he dies because he's covered in a coffin, I believe through those selfish reasons man should limit his meat consumption. Unfortunately though there are proteins and other nutrients found specifically in meat which currently have no alternative sources for, so we humans do not eat meat for pleasure only but to also meet their diet demands."

Maybe in the future it will be clear that veganism was always better option, but for now we have different generations of people, who have different habits. We can't just make everyone to stop eating meat and we also shouldn't be critical about people who eat meat. We have been eating meat since our beginnings and it's natural for us. But natural not always mean healthy. I think in the best scenario veganism will be our primary option for diet, but not necessarily the only one. All what I said mainly refers to our health. As for the animals themselves, there is another quite interesting problem. If we stop eating meat, what will be the point of keeping any animals alive? Only to be our puppets? It's sad to think that some animals are literally made to be kill and eaten, but it's the violent truth."

Veganism is also good for the planet because it does not harm any animals and there is no production of food that contains toxic substances that damage the environment. Animals play a crucial part in our lives and slaughtering them does not good and it affects the ecosystem. However, veganism can be detrimental to some people's health because research shows that it may cause people to lack important nutrients that are important for the body. This can cause long-term damage. Veganism also has the potential to damage the soil as it is crucial to growing vegetables and fruits. "

I believe veganism can be a healthy diet to a lot of people, but as an anemic person myself, I really need animal proteins for my body to create red cells, wich will help my body to prevent and combat sicknesses and illnesses. For practical reasons, I don't think veganism is the most practical way of living and thinking because vegan products cost a lot of money, so in comparison, if you are at the supermarket debating wether you'll take a steak for dinner or a steak substitute, you're more likely to get the real steak, as it's much cheaper than the other one."
60a227e0a1929284d58c8030,"Veganism is part of a lifestyle now. It isn't uncommon to be a vegan. Ages ago, people didn't broadcast that they were vegans or if they did, they tried to convince others to become a vegan. There can be radical people who push hard to stop people from killing animals / eating meat. There are many more farms around now that farm animals in an ethical environment and cull ethically too. Vegans will say it is unnecessary to even have such farms as it is unethical to kill an animal for food. Each side has a good reason and it is very individual which choice either make. It does seem cruel to kill an animal to be able to eat it. Culling is sometimes necessary and understandable. But still cruel in a way. Vegans claim that meat is unhealthy for the body. Non vegans claim that each person needs meat for vitamins and nutrients. Vegans state that is easily found in non meat products. Or taking a supplement to make up for the vitamins that, for example, red meat would give to the body. In my opinion, most meats we can buy, are unhealthy and just factory farms. Which I find cruel and horrific and shouldn't be allowed. All the nasty products used to factory farm are unhealthy for the body. When one is faced with a chornic disease or a cancer, then one starts examining every food that one can buy. It is at that point that you realise that meat is not good for the body because of the antibiotics and hormones that factory farming is based on, never mind other products that we are not aware of. Therefore, ultimately, meat eating is not something the body needs or wants when faced with a cancer or disease. So why eat meat at all then. If one can know the Farmer personally and know that the animals are house well, fed well, allowed to forage, allowed to sleep extra in winter, not force fed and not forced fed artificial products, antibiotics etc. Then a small amount of red meat or chicken or fish can help with some nutrients the body needs.

I think veganism is very important in that same aspect, animals go through horrible processes just to serve as food.


As a result of their ethical principles, vegans, like vegetarians, do not consume red meat, fish, poultry or insects. Vegans also do not consume other foods of animal origin, such as dairy, eggs or honey, due to the suffering inflicted on animals in obtaining these foods. Contrary to what many people think, egg production and milk production also involve the slaughter of animals.
For example, in the egg industry, newborn chicks are separated according to their sex, and males are killed because they do not lay eggs, so they are useless for the industry. In the dairy industry, it is extremely common for dairy cows to be taken to the slaughterhouse when they are considered ""unproductive"", that is, when their milk production decreases to the point where the animal is no longer considered profitable or when the cows are unable to get pregnant easily."

- I also believe that veganism can be a healthy diet, particularly for those seeking weight loss, as many animal products contain many high calorie items.

Cons:
-Following a vegan diet can often result in a lack of fat and protein, which can often be vital for human beings.

On the one hand, there are people who believe that it is morally wrong to eat meat and animal products, and that such actions cause unnecessary suffering among animals. On the other hand, there are people who believe veganism is too extreme and unnecessary for their lifestyle. The reality, though, is that how you view veganism depends on what you believe about animal rights, animal ethics, and global climate change. There are several important environmental issues at play when considering veganism as a lifestyle choice. I'm personally not a vegan myself, but I respect the lifestyle choice and its followers. However, I think that veganism should be treated like any other dietary choices or restrictions: if you want to be a vegan, go ahead and do it. If you don't want to be a vegan, don't worry about it. Either way, everyone will end up having what they want from their own lifestyles without rubbing it in anyone else's faces. Just my two cents.."

Vegan foods also require less energy and have overall a way lesser impact on gas emissions and wastes. It's important however to consider that in order to have an healthy and complete diet, by going vegan, you must consume a lot of different types of food to get the same amount of vital compounds required by our body, especially since vegan food lack some essential amino-acids from meat proteins and importan vitamins; vegan food also lack iron, and other important ions, and because of this and the other reasons I think it shouldn't be forced on children."

A vegan diet is a vegetarian eating style, but it's completely devoid of animal products, including eggs, honey, and dairy products. Some vegans choose the diet for health reasons, but others prefer it for ethical reasons, such as avoiding animal cruelty and consuming more sustainable foods.

While there are documented health benefits of a vegan diet, some find the lifestyle challenging to maintain. Consider each of the pros and cons of a vegan diet before you decide if it is the right program for you.

Pros
•        Evidence-based health benefits
•        Encourages mindful eating
•        Wider variety of foods
•        Reduced food costs
•        No animal impact
Cons
•        Limited food choices
•        Possible nutrient deficiencies
•        Requires diligence
•        Difficulty dining out
•        Unrealistic expectations

The nutritional quality of a vegan diet leads to more significant health benefits. Eating a diet rich in plant-based foods has been associated with a decreased risk of many chronic diseases.

5f2e4f6e9832d71ae6cdc4ab,"Certainly veganism is good for the environment and for animals. It is very easy to find positive things in it, but the negative ones should not be ignored. First of all, the ease with which one can end up in nutritional deficit with an exclusively vegan diet. Secondly, many animals today exist solely by virtue of their food or production use. Before having a vegan transition, one should find a way to safely re-home such animals, to avoid achieving the very thing one is trying to avoid--more animal cruelty. For example? Cows, pigs, chickens have no chance of living in the wild, and it would be unthinkable to have their existence solely based on educational farms. If a way is not found to re-employ such animals, they are not only doomed to die but also to total extinction."

Strict vegans even avoid using any product that have been tested on animals or wear leather or wool. So is this vegan diet healthy?

There are many benefits of a plant-based diet and are claimed to be the healthiest diet to follow since they prioritize naturally sourced plant-based foods like fruits and vegetables. But are there any cons to this diet?

Vegan diets can be low on protein and fat, basically being a vegetarian can have common nutrient deficiencies. Vegans have more trouble achieving protein needs without using protein supplements. They therefore need more protein as the protein quality is lower compared to meat eaters"

If applied correctly and in a scientific manner, veganism can help solve some problems related to insufficient food resources worldwide and improve the ecological footprint of the human race, thanks to the fact that plant products need far fewer resources to be produced. with respect to animal products (or in any case of animal derivation).
Given that the problem of the overpopulation of our planet will probably not be solved within a few years (or even decades), I think that humanity will have to adapt quickly to a diet in which animal proteins will be much less today than vegetable ones. and therefore I believe that an increasingly large slice of the population will embrace the vegan cause and stop using animal-derived products, also due to the overexploitation of world agricultural resources."

Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and cooking, and improve your diet. Getting your nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting options like whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables, which are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.
From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is to avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow flatulence!"

Advantages of Veganism

Useful diet for weight loss. High intake of fiber. Prevents Animals from going extinct. Non-vegans will have no issues meeting daily protein requirements. Naturally high carbohydrate diets to support endurance training.

Disadvantages of Veganism
Being a vegetarian can have common nutrient deficiencies. Vegan diets can be low in protein and fat. Vegans have more trouble achieving protein needs without using protein supplements. Animal cruelty."

Avoiding consumption of animals is a good idea however the world is facing some shortage of food in some countries and some other places cannot opt for animal free foods due to being unable to plant because of climate change(lack of rain, drought and even floods). However there are concepts such as Halaal food that promotes less cruelty to animals but do not restrict their consumption which i feel are much more considerate than veganism."

However cruelty to animals should be condemned by all means. There are people who domesticate animals and then mistreat them by not feeding them and giving them medical care, this is wrong.

There are also people who kill wild animals either for cultural reasons or selfish financial reasons, this too is wrong and should be stopped.

But whenever an animal is killed for beneficial purposes, there is nothing wrong with that according to my opinion. Animals provide wool  to keep us warm and clothed. They provide for our footwear and other ornaments like bags etc.

If you are eating a vegan diet, you will eat a ton of different vegetables and fruits which you might not be if you’re eating meat. On the other hand, vegans can have problems getting all the nutrition that a human needs to stay healthy, as their diets can be low in protein, fat and other nutrients. Vegans will often have to take supplements such for some things like protein to meet their daily goals.
However, vegans have a high intake of fiber.

Vegans also have a reduced risk of cardiovascular and heart diseases, which I think other than caring about the lives of the animals, is the biggest benefit of veganism. 

I will say that I am not a fan of the whole culture surrounding vegans. My own philosophy is “live and let live”, I don’t care about what others are eating, I don’t want them commenting on my diet and so I won’t comment on theirs. But vegans I’ve met are often very much in your face about it. If they’re not yelling at someone for eating meat and calling them names such as “animal murderer”, they’re loudly telling everyone within earshot that they’re vegans and why everyone else should be too.

Can be harmful to the digestive tract 
Reduces intake of some antioxidants

There’s growing evidence that reduced consumption of animal products, coupled with an increase in plant-based foods, seems to be good for our health, mostly because of the antioxidants present in the food. There is also the anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based food. I think veganism could be good for you because it can protect against cardiosvascular diseases, by reducing obesity and lowering cholesterol. 
On the other hand we do need all essential amino acids to be healthy, which is why diets that rely on a very limited range of protein sources should be avoided. Also, no plant foods are known to produce vitamin B12 - and low B12 levels can lead to megaloblastic anaemia. Whereas the fact that vegetarians benefit from increased longevity does not imply that this would also be the case for vegans, there is evidence that people who consume large quantities of fruits and vegetables—foods that tend to be more prominent in vegan diets—live longer than those who do not do so."

610ec6bd9cbda4d4dee9b3a1,"VEGANISM

‘Veganism’ is a philosophy that operates like a faith, and they’re looking for reasons why science wouldn’t contradict their faith. (Or inventing reasons why it doesn’t). There’s no rationality in this, and no logical way to explain it.

(Also, humans have been eating meat for millions of years, not just thousands — all of the species they evolved from were omnivorous, as primates generally are. Homo heidelbergensis upped the ante by becoming a large game hunter. It was our immediate predecessor, and Homo sapiens have always been large game hunters as well).

Veganism and vegetarianism are only a function of modern society. For the vast majority of human evolution we ate a varied diet that included meat, insects, plants and a few grains. Most of the modern vegetarian foods, especially the “meat substitutes” are actually less healthy for you than real meat and also cause more environmental damage in the growing, processing and distribution. We have been hunters and gatherers far longer than we have been farmers and growing vegetable and grain crops is actually very unnatural for the human species.

Some people can do ok on a vegetarian diet that includes eggs but no human can thrive on a vegan diet without the aid of artificial supplements only made possible by modern technology.

So my feeling is that vegan and vegetarians are ignoring basic biology and are so far removed from the source of food they really have no understanding of how humans and meat producing animals coexist and thrive and are symbiotic. We need each other to survive and yes, the best way to preserve rare breeds, unusual species and a healthy diverse farming ecosystem is to eat meats in appropriate amounts from humanly raised and killed animals on a regular basis.

I absolute agree with the fact that we need to reduce the consumption of meat, and i absolutely agree that intensive farming should stop but meat is fundamental, and technology now allows us to create meat in laboratory without hurting animals. Created meat isn't widespread now, but if the future it will. For now we can adopt policies that defend animals' right and reduce cruelty on them. Meat is irreplaceble because contains proteins that veggies or cereals don't. Veganism can't be applied absolutely on children. I have read of children died because they were forced to follow this strict diet and i absolutely disagree on that.

6153ca3f0c560379c9ed7539,"Veganism is a hot topic nowadays. First of all, scientists advise us to consume less meat in order to help battle climate change. Less meat means less use of natural resources (water, land, energy etc), less carbon dioxide and methane emissions and of course minimised deforestication.  Doctors also point out that our diet has to improve due to health issues. According to several studies a decrease in meat and animal fats consumption could lead to a decrease in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity and general mortality rates. Groups against animal cruelty advocate as well a meatless or at least a meatlow diet. On the other hand humans have consumed meat for thousand of years and it is embedded both in our culinary traditions as well in our gastronomical ""DNA"". Going full vegan could also mean absence not only from meat but other animal products like eggs and milk and their derivatives (cheese, yoghurt, butter). What would be the impact both to producers and consumers alike? My personal opinion would be to lie somewhere in the middle. Going meat-low and of course not avoiding animal products helps the planet and keeps up with our society's traditions. "
60c21f5f1389f65d2d88a3bf,"Veganism is truly a controversial topic and has been mocked around in the internet and social media in the last years. From my point of view, I consider veganism a huge sacrifice anyone can do in order to prevent animal cruelty. 
The pros of veganism are, as said before, related to preventing animal cruelty in all forms, since a vegan cannot eat anything related to the animals (not just the animals, like a vegetarian, but also the products that come from the animal). This prevents the animals to be mistreated while they are still alive.
However, some of the cons that veganism present is that some of the nutrients that our body needs are obtained from animals. And even though there has been technological advances in food in a way to give this nutrients to our bodies in other forms, this has created some things that might not be save for us or are totally artificial and in the end will can create more harm."
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,"I think each and every person is entitled to make their own decisions when it comes to what to eat, however what I disagree with is people trying to force these ideas on others. I think there should be more ways to raise awareness surrounding veganism as I think a lot of people do not understand what they actually can and can't eat and this can be really off putting. I think it is definitely a far more sustainable way of eating compared to those who eat meat and fish etc. However, I think at the moment a lot of people are vegan because it is the in thing. It seems to be a fashion statement for people at the moment instead of actually having the environmental impact in mind. It is more sustainable, it prevents animal cruelty and means that there is less meat production. However, the cons are that diet is more limited, although there are lots of vegetarian options to remove meat from ones diet, there are not many completely vegan options. It also makes it more difficult for people to get the nutrients etc that they need to survive. "
627e7e91d0e389328983e765,"I am not a vegan, although I know people who are - I personally do not think that a wholey vegan diet is natural - it is also difficult to cook lots of meals - I find it tricky to reproduce what eggs do in certain recipes using any kind of plant-based substitute.
I think it is fine for people to have any diet that they may wish, but they should not expect or try to force other people to follow their suit. I find that many vegans are very keen to tell you of the sins of eating meat - and this does not their campaign any favours. I personally believe that all animals produced for meat should be treated with a dutiful amount of respect and humanity - if they lead a good life, then they are likely to taste better anyway!
The problem with veganism is that it becomes the lowest common denominator - inasmuch as if you have a vegan around for dinner, then you have to cook a vegan meal for them - but if you go around their's for dinner, they will not cook you a meat-based meal in return. In this way, it can be seen to be a bit imbalanced."
61687ebcd2a35ffb762d1928,"Personally as a meat eater, after reading about the benefits of eating less meat i have been trying my upmost best to cut down on my meat and dairy consumption. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest way to reduce our environmental impact on the environment. People who advocate for veganism have a valid point as studies do show that eating a higher fibre, plant based diet is so much better for your health. It's a win-win situation for both your physical health and the environment. Opting for fresh produce that is locally grown can help reduce carbon footprints. However, there are cons as the body needs nutrients that sometimes meat can provide. Although, one might argue that these are transferable and you can get the same nutrients from plants that you get from meat sometimes it's just not the same. But i do definitely see the need to eat less meat and dairy products."
5ea00a03e32996000ac2da80,"Veganism is a very contraversial topic, a bit like religion! It brings out strong opinions and beliefs which are often passed down from generation to generation. Younger people are usually more open minded and willing to listen and change. I eat little meat and try to eat plant based when I can, it is healthier for my body and better for the environment but I am lucky to be able to afford any extra cost in shops and eating out places. By eating less meat, we would have a healthier society and less pressure on medical services, leaving room for people in real need. Some diseases are preventable by the food we eat. By making it more affordable, and selling all the positives to the public, we can make change. Health groups such as Bowel Cancer should be given healthy budgets to get the message across as just one example."
6012f0c0e9c54b105f296ada,"I respect their ideals but I don't share them. Yes, it is true that I agree that we have to drastically reduce the consumption of meat and fish but not completely eliminate them from our diet. I think that limiting the intake of meat to once a week and that it is of quality and avoiding being cruel to animals is enough
Among its advantages we have that this diet is healthier than that currently followed by the majority of the population and is more respectful of the environment.
Disadvantages should complement your diet with products that make up for the lack of meat and fish intake, and in this sense I am not sure if these supplements are healthier than eating meat and fish
For all this, I consider that the best solutions is a diet in which meat and fish are eaten occasionally, but the majority of the intake is vegetable products."
6143bbc4daab169ed298722c,"Veganism is a lifestyle that abstains from the use of animal products. Vegans don’t eat animal-derived foods such as meats, milk, and dairy either. Many vegans also boycott clothing and other products that involve animal exploitation, such as leather and fur. I am pro veganism because I am a vegan, there are only pros to veganism and those who advocate it as it not only helps our planet but keeps our bodies clean and healthy on the inside.

Firstly, veganism is great for the environment .Factory farming is responsible for deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and water shortages. Livestock and their byproducts are accountable for greenhouse gas emissions, worldwide. 
Animal agriculture is responsible for Amazon rainforest destruction.

Secondly, veganism can save our oceans. Animal agriculture causes ocean dead zones due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change which is ruining marine ecosystems

Lastly, a plant-based diet increases metabolism The metabolism of people who follow a plant-based diet burns calories faster on average than the metabolism of meat-eaters for the first few hours after meals.

60fd425228a705aeec26c55c,"I think veganism is a good thing, but you have to know a lot about it and be smart with it. First I will say about pros. We don’t hurt animals. I totally believe that every animal have feelings, I love all animals and I don’t want to hurt them. Sometimes animals are killing in dramatic condition, that’s awful. Vegan people are people who want peace, and it’s very good, we don’t want to hurt each other. Veganism ibrings together people with the same views and forms a group of friends who fight for the same purpose. That is something beautiful and it shows that we can work together in peace and do something good for world. About cons, it’s hard to be vegan and be totally healthy. It’s not so easy to don’t eat meat and replace it just by fruits and vegetables. This can cause health problems, for example anemia"
617406fbfced12169896d158,"I honestly have my doubts about whether veganism is sustainable long term for everyone. I've not see any figures for how much land it would take per person to  feed them a balanced and healthy diet. Given the size of the world population I suspect that the amount needed would far outstrip the land available. We would then be back to the current problem of chopping down forests and jungles and building huge factories to 'grow' organisms that could be processed into 'food' for the billions on earth. It is I'm afraid a idea in search of solution and it is one that really has not been studied well enough. The rich would of course have first choice of produce and the poor would get the leavings. It makes me think of the hunger games where communities were pitted one against another, only this time it would be countries. So for me, Veganism for all is NOT a viable option."
61267b828ead584bcf092e35,"Veganism is created for a good cause. For the protection of animals around the because most animals like certain species are becoming distinct. To provide more help to nature and animals people feel the need to not eat meat and just live their lives eating vegetables. The pros of this are that more animals are being preserved for generations to be able to witness such breeds. More and more animals are receiving protection from people instead of killing them. Even wild animals are being helped by humans when they are in trouble instead of people turning a blind eye or killing them. However, the con of veganism is the lack of proteins in one's body for not eating meat. These proteins are provided mostly from animal meat to develop muscle and a proper balance of vitamins and proteins in your body. People end up damaging lands trying to cultivate, irrigate and harvest too much trying to produce more vegetables, but they end up being expensive in the markets for people to buy."
56cf6e8d31a5bc0006e1cdf5,"Veganism is practised by several of my friends and happily they do not preach. One is constantly anaemic and poorly, one is in tip top condition but consumes only shakes, and one eats normally but leaves any meat off the plate. So I guess there is no one size fits all. I would support reduction of meat in my diet but am unsure how to keep enjoying my meals as much as I do now. I think I am too old to try!
I think of the local landscape - there would be no fields of sheep or cattle, just veggie growing - that is fine. Would pets have to be banned too?
What alternatives are there, eg for milk? Everything I read suggests other sources of (plant)""milk"" require vast amounts of land and particularly water use and lack nutrients that cows' milk has. I would miss leather items - plastic was an alternative but that's got a bad name now too! "
5d3873197860c8001a106e02,I do not really care about veganism as long as I am left alone and they do not want to force it on me. If it is good for them I am happy for it but they have to accept that not everybody thinks the same way and if somebody wants to eat meat than they should be free to do it. I love meat and I would not give up eating it for anything. Of course I love animals and there are certain kind I wouldn't eat but that's that. If I would fight for something that is animal related it would be animal testing. Products should be cruelty free because I do not want animals to suffer. Same goes to producing meat. If they have to cut down animals they should do it quickly and animals should be kept in good conditions. This is what I would fight for and I would even pay more money for meat if these condtions are met

I don't advocate for animal cruelty or killings of endangered animals or any form of animal testing. There are sustainable farms and would opt for free range products or happy animal deaths. I am not against the vegan movement and have considered it but I just feel the should be a balance somewhere along the line regardless of being able  to obtain protein and other nutrients in plants and other substitutes.
I love animals as well and know that it takes our bodies much longer to completely rid ourselves the meat we eat as opposed to plant based diets but that is not much to sway me otherwise. There are other ways to raise our vibration as well which I gladly put to use."
60fe7c857e049641f422a6f4,"As a scientist, I am fully for the protection of animals in all senses but with that being said, it is important that people make decisions for themselves without enforcing their choice on others. In a perfect world, veganism would be a “good” choice in order to save, protect and ensure the preservation of many animals. Veganism does come with many pros and cons and for one to become vegan, it is important that they weigh these out before making their decision. Going vegan ensures the safety of many animals but reduces the sources of food that form a balanced diet. There are also many vegan-substitutes or alternatives that are widely known allergens, further reduces the spectrums of food individuals are allowed to consume in order to satisfy their daily requirements. While factors such as cruelty to animals can be prevented without veganism, through SPCAS and the eliminating the use of animals as test subjects, the consumption of animal products remains controversial. Many studies have shown that there are specific dietary requirements for proteins and other essential nutrients such as Iron that can only be obtained through the consumption of meat and other animal products. In some cases, there are specific dietary requirements. People who advocate for veganism do have good intentions, however, they need to understand that it is not for everyone and that each person as a right to choose what they consume. Each individual has to make a conscious decisions about their lifestyles and what they want to use to sustain their bodies. "
5ebd495e39fb6f017b95054a,"Humans are animals and this is often forgotten. As animals, humans, like many other animals, eat other animals. Whilst intensive farming practices such as battery hen farming are wrong, eating animals is not wrong in principal and this can be achieved - and for centuries until recently was achieved - without cruelty. I can also see no rational reason for refusing to eat animal by-products such as unfertilised eggs. Dairy milk is very nutritious for humans and while there is an environmental impact on dairy farming, the debate around this has been enormously over-simplified as it not as simple as usually presented. Dairy farming in the UK, for example, causes massively fewer emissions than in some other countries where it is far more intensive, and the same applies to meat production. UK beef production can have less of an impact than chocolate production in some areas, but this is never pointed out in over-simplified debates. Consequently, I feel the environmental benefits of veganism have been greatly exaggerated. I also have serious doubts about the health benefits of veganism, as backed up by a number of research studies. "

Vegans have lowered risks of chronic diseases meaning they are healthier, positive environmental and ethical impact, lower grocery costs. While all this sounds great there are also disadvantages such as vegans have lack of nutrients and it is very difficult to adopt a new lifestyle. Veganism has proven to be healthier for the environment and non vegan to be cruel. I personally am not against veganism but its not my thing. I do not like the fact that vegan people want us to feel guilty for eating meat or for having a different diet from them. Our ancestors have eaten meat. Science has all kinds of relevant information about how humans are evolved omnivores, how animal proteins did not only keep ancient humans alive, but also helped to develop our brains .Everyone has a choice, each to their own."

On the contrary. the number of people on the globe is increasing, along with this the need to feed more people and food animals is growing. With the increase in people, there is no increase in farmland. Veganism solves this, and reduces cruelty to animals. Plant-based substitutes can fully replace a meat-based diet. And deficiencies related to the lack of certain proteins, for example, can be supplemented. Currently, the price of vegan products is slightly higher than standard food, but as veganism becomes more popular, prices will be correspondingly lower. With popularity, the limited choice of vegan food will also disappear. Eating only plant-based food will have a positive effect on our health, blood pressure and chorelestelor levels.  The likelihood of heart or circulatory system diseases will decrease."
60f9baa99f49184f083a9ce8,"A vegan diet is a vegetarian eating style, except it excludes any animal products, such as dairy, honey, and eggs. Others choose the vegan diet for ethical reasons, such as avoiding animal cruelty and eating more sustainably produced goods. Some vegans follow the diet for health-related reasons. Although a vegan diet has been shown to have positive health effects, some people find the lifestyle difficult to keep up. Adopting a vegan diet has several benefits, including improved health and mindful eating. Being plant-based, a vegan diet makes it simpler to consume large amounts of the nutritious whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables that many people on standard diets lack. According to studies comparing various diets, following a vegan diet has the highest nutritional quality. A vegan diet typically has reduced calorie and saturated fat intake while being higher in fibre, vitamin C, magnesium, iron, and folate. The practice of mindful eating entails paying closer attention to our food and developing a more sensory awareness and experience of a meal. To enjoy the act of eating rather than focusing on a particular nutritional result, the diner must do so consciously (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates). Practices of mindful eating have been incorporated into several weight-loss regimens because they are linked to a healthier relationship with food. Additionally, there are certain drawbacks to a vegan diet, such as fewer food options and some nutritional inadequacies. The vegan diet is frequently described as the strictest type of plant-based eating. You should anticipate removing the majority of foods from your regular weekly menu if you embrace this eating plan. That degree of limitation may be too much for some folks. A vegan diet is like a vegetarian diet, but it forbids the use of any animal products, including dairy, honey, and eggs. Others follow a vegan diet for moral grounds, such as abstaining from cruelty to animals and consuming more products made using sustainable practices. Some vegans adhere to the diet for medical reasons. I personally think one should be fully aware of all the pros and cons of the diet before attempting to adopt it."

The use of this type of diet reduces the risk of heart disease, lowers cholesterol, reduces obesity or overweight, causes fewer tumors and lowers blood pressure. Weight loss may be due to higher consumption of low-energy and high-fiber fruits and vegetables, provided by a vegan or vegetarian diet. Contrary to appearances, a vegan diet can also be used by athletes. To properly balance the diet of a vegan athlete, you really need a lot of knowledge and knowledge of plant aminograms. By switching to a vegan diet, we reduce the demand for animal products, which as a result reduces the number of animals killed. In addition to food products, vegans also avoid cosmetics tested on animals and clothing made of leather. You can get almost any nutritional value you need
man by eating only plant-based food (the only one
exceptions are vitamins D and B12) - it is all thanks to minerals, enzymes,
antioxidants and soil nutrients. Tests
showed that livestock farming contributes to soil erosion,
desertification and limitation of forests. As a result of these processes, in
the United States alone was lost about a third
arable land. We are encouraged to save energy and one of the best
methods is to give up meat and dairy products. Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from hunger and malnutrition, yet grain is used as animal feed. Millions of tons of food fit for humans that could end hunger on earth once and for all, and instead end up in livestock."

6097e36e99d6c893daf55676,"Several people, in recent years, avoiding the consumption of meat and all products of animal origin, are trying to reduce their environmental impact and safeguard animal health.
This essay will deal with analyzing both the positive and negative aspects of veganism.
The positive aspects are numerous and concern animal welfare and environmental protection. First of all, many animals are raised on intensive farms, where they don't have enough room to move around easily and are treated with antibiotics and hormones. Avoiding meat has a positive impact on the environment, since thousands of liters of water and a much larger surface area are needed to produce a kilogram of meat than the crops required.
On the other hand, avoiding eating products of animal origin can lead, if not supported by a good nutritionist, to deficiencies in vitamins and other elements such as iron. This can lead to serious health problems.
In conclusion, veganism helps protect the rights of animals, ensure their well-being and reduce their environmental impact."
602d29200724e36ae7a9def2,"Go Vegan

These are the advantages and disadvantages in practicing veganism. They are in no way typical of all vegans. Each vegan will experience things differently and some will see what I consider a disadvantage as an advantage or opportunity and obviously vice versa.
I no longer live a life where my value system is in opposition to my life choices. I have always felt I loved animals and from childhood wished all sorts of ill-well onto people who abused and hurt animals yet I continued eating them or being entertained by them. I always felt a sense of guilt but lacked the courage to listen to the voice telling me “This is wrong; stop it”. It took a long time but I've finally listened.
 
The main disadvantage is that I am more aware each day of the cruelty we impose on animals. It hurts me that I can do so little to influence other people to see what I see and make a plan to do something about it. Veganism has not in any way come near to reaching the critical mass required to make a meaningful difference to end needless animal suffering on a mass scale."

Pros:
1-If you feel that how humans treat animals is wrong and needs to change you can feel good about your contribution.
2-It is easier to avoid a notable segment of unhealthy foods by avoiding animal products.
3-You get a sense of fulfillment by being a part of a specific community.
Cons:

1-It takes time and research to make sure you are meeting all of your nutritional needs and thus not harming your health.
2-It can be, and usually is, more expensive to maintain a vegan diet
3-People can be judgemental of you
4-You can become judgemental of others
Overall, there is nothing inherently bad about maintaining a vegan diet. If this is what you want to seriously try I would speak to a dietician or look for some reputable (!) sources that can help you determine what essential nutrients are harder to obtain in a vegan diet and how to obtain them."

Veganism is a very helpful dietary option to further help towards helping animals and the planet. The consumption of meat has been normalized since thousands of years ago, however, there have been civilizations which have focused on plant based diets, this not only provides a high amounts of nutrients and vitamins for the body but it also helps advocate towards animal cruelty. It may seem like it is a harsh jump to go from being an omnivore to not eating any animal based foods. However, there are ways to help with the transition, the easiest way to start is to reduce meat intake during weekly meals. Then switching to only eating a meal a week and eventually only sea food as meat based meals. Before one knows it, the craving for meat is fading away and it is way easier to transition. Not only does it help our health but animals and the planet, as well as the future of humanity."

For many vegans, living a committed vegan lifestyle means not wearing clothes made from animal skins and avoiding any products which have been tested on animals.
Vegetarians don’t eat meat or fish but they can eat eggs, honey and dairy products, but
vegans don’t eat any animal-based food products. Vegans argue that suffering is caused in
the production of these foods, for example they say that, on some dairy farms, male calves
are killed because they are too expensive to keep, and on some farms, cows are killed when
they get older and produce less milk.
The Vegan Society was founded in 1944, but there is evidence of people deciding not to
consume animal products over 2,000 years ago. The sixth-century BC Greek mathematician
and philosopher Pythagoras was in favour of kindness to all species, and his diet could be
described as vegetarian. There was a tradition of vegetarianism in the Indus Valley,
Babylonian and ancient Egyptian civilisations even earlier. The Vegan Society points out that
in 1806, the famous romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was one of the first people to
publicly object to eating eggs and dairy products on moral grounds."

An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans, also known as ""strict vegetarians"", refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances. An ethical vegan is someone who not only follows a plant-based diet but extends the philosophy into other areas of their lives, opposes the use of animals for any purpose, and tries to avoid any cruelty and exploitation of all animals including humans. Another term is ""environmental veganism"", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.

Well-planned vegan diets are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, as said by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the British Dietetic Association,Dietitians of Canada, the New Zealand Ministry of Health and the Italian Society of Human Nutrition."

5eb64825c23fbf5300fb5bd9,"Veganism is a noble ideal which I wholeheartedly can get behind, with some caviats. The main problem with contemporous veganism is its radicalization, it has over time moved beyond being a moral choice made by an individual to a moral choice imposed by a collective. This is especially problematic as veganism is at one end of a spectra; forcefully trying to move people towards it will turn many towards the other. 

Many do not share such empathic feeling towards all animals and will not react the same way to such arguments based on compassion. I believe in incentivizing moral and positive directions through things like nudging, not by shaming. Especially in terms of something on the extreme end, it would perhaps be better to nudge people to eat things like meat in a much more sustainable way. If people ate meat perhaps a couple of days a week at most, the meat industry could tone down their mass production methods. People could use the additional money for well produced products which will involve much less animal cruelty."

This sounds pretty great, however you should remember that sudden change in the diet could bring more cons than pros. Turning vegetarian or vegan should be well-planned. It's proven that going vegan side effects sometimes include anemia, disruptions in hormones production, vitamin B12 deficiencies, and depression from a lack of omega-3 fatty acids. That’s why it’s crucial to include plenty of proteins and reasonable nutrition."
60e223997949aa8e7632763d,"I strongly believe that every person has the right to their own beliefs and life choices and believe that animal deserve to treated fairly. however, human beings are just like animals and in the animal kingdom there are those that hunt and those that are hunted, there is a life cycle. so although it has many health benefits, it is sustainable for the future many religions count of the animals in this regard.

Many countries still do not have enough alternative for veganism and this often pricy not everyone can afford this lifestyle. Therefore animals and their byproducts can be consumed and have the same result as veganism this can be done by controlling the environment and the conditions under which they are consumed.

animals can be killed in a humane manner where they do not feel pain or are illtreated "
616ef5825430c20775b0af29,"Well, it is clear that lately the animals are being treated cruelly, one will pass a dead dog on the streets. of which was supposed to be buried well and no one would notice that the dog is dead. Also, this thing of punishing donkeys for reason and turning them into transport is very wrong. People should buy cars and stop whatever nonsense they are doing to the poor donkeys. whatever is happening with the wild animals is also pure nonsense as well, the hunting and killing of the wild animals are affecting us a lot and reducing the wild animals from the biosystem and we will be left with pride anymore as a country, because the wild animals will be instinct. and the country will be even poorer than it is now. we need strong security that will protect the animals."
60e2fbb1eec0ddbbe525aa49,"Veganism is a lifestyle which seeks to exclude, as far practically as possible, all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose. A vegan diet excludes meat, eggs, dairy products and all other animal derived ingredient. I think about this and I love the idea of protecting animals and caring for them. I love the idea because I believe it can also easily be healty eating because most of their diet contains plants but howsoever I worry about the lack of nutrients that people who practice veganism(diet) might suffer. I am aware that most people who go into this diet they research it thoroughly and find creative ways to make up for all the nutrients lost from food that they cannot consume and they even take supplements to make up for such. With all that considered I personally support the course but I do not think the body can full recover from not having all these nutrients supplied."
604d603b057fd944c370a451,"The biggest problem about veganism is that the taste and the nutritional values of this kind of products is not as pleasing as the common products that we usually eat, but that also is the objective that we should approach to find a solution to this problem.

The first option would be to make some kind of flavoring that is identical to the real thing, like a meat flavoring that can be used in things like tofu and non-meat burgers to emulate the taste of real meat.

The next step would be to add the necesary suplements to cover the lack of nutrients in this kind of food, and that shouldn't be a problem with the current technology we have.

The final step would be to advertise this food as a revolutionary thing that can replace the meat without any inconvenience, and then the problem would be solved."

There are many benefits of a plant-based diet and are claimed to be the healthiest diet to follow because they prioritise naturally sourced plant based foods (fruits and vegetables, legumes, and whole grains). This is great and exactly how all diets should be but are there any downsides to a plant-based diet? Here we’re going to outline any potential risks and help all people who choose to adopt a plant based diet to get the best results.
Vegan diet helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and heart disease: One of the significant contributing elements to heart disease is your diet. The vegan diet prioritises a wealth of natural, nutrient-dense plant-based foods that promote heart health. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc., all have excellent health properties.
It also helps to improve blood sugar levels: Type 2 diabetes is a global health issue. However, some studies show that a vegan diet plays a specific role in improving blood sugar levels. It typically reduces the intake of poor quality processed foods overconsumed in typical Western diets and contributes to type 2 diabetes.
On the other hand, vegans run the risk of potential nutritional deficiency: A vegan diet may lack some of the critical nutrients required for the body, such as protein, vitamin B-12, omega 3 fatty acids, zinc, and iron.
Following a vegan diet requires knowing about the key foods that should be combined together and prioritised to sufficiently meet these nutrient intakes, and by analysing your diet (with the help of a registered dietitian/nutritionist), to see if you require any additional supplements to prevent any nutrient deficiencies if you struggle to obtain these nutrients through food alone.

5e6473fbc15dbe1f71eea95b,"Veganism one option a person might select in attempts to lower their negative environmental impact on he world. Rearing farm animals creates pollution gasses and takes up ample space on earth, land that is permanently altered to fit the needs of feeding animals who then in turn feed humans. However, non-animal based farming is just as problematic and takes up just as much of the earth's resources. There is considerably less cruelty to animals, however. A lifestyle choice on a personal level is one's prerogative, but like any social cause that gains traction of large groups of individuals, it runs the risk of taking on a religious type following that forgets it's original tenants. Militant vegans forget about compassion, litter the world with plastic backed stickers, care about animals but not fellow man. Having pictures of slaughtered cows on public transit is not exactly non-violence, refusing to talk to a friend because they dont like your tofu dip is not compassion. "
5ecfa3e67fd043000aee9fb4,"In my opinion, it is very good to follow a vegan diet, but I think that life without meat is very hard, so I will never decide to go on a vegan diet. Obviously this is a kind of animal protection, but why should we eat lettuce, for example, in our vegan diet? It seems to me that it is comparable to animals because there is also an organism living there. The protection of animals in these times is very important, but that's what animal farms are for. I can understand if an animal is under protection, but why if we can keep animals we shouldn't consume them? A vegan diet is very healthy and improves our health, but without meat, we cannot build large muscles, for example. The same goes for all kinds of dairy products. We can produce dairy without killing animals, so why not eat it? In my opinion, we are not adapted to a continuous life without animal products. It's just impossible, so in my opinion a vegan diet is totally pointless. I have never been interested in the vegan diet so I can't write more about it. I will stay with normal diet :D
